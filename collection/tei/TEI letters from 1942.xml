            <p>Dhalling Mhor doesn’t seem like Dhalling <lb/> Mhor now you are not here. You had
               become so <lb/> much a part of the life here, so far as I was <lb/> concerned, that
               things seem a bit dead now<lb/> you have gone.</p>
            <p>By this time you will be at home<lb/> or very near home (time six o’clock) and
               looking mournfully at the weather; it’s bound to be raining<lb/> in Manchester as it
               is here still. You have been<lb/> much in my thoughts as you made the beastly<lb/>
               railway journey and I kept saying to myself, “They<lb/> will have reached Glasgow
               now; they will be on the<lb/> M/C train now.”</p>
            <p> I can’t say how much I’ve missed<lb/> you today. I’ve wondered round a bit on my own,<lb/>
               <pb facs="xxx"/><!-- enter correct page here --> and played cards a bit with the
               older generation,<lb/> and slept a bit. Harry and Ellie, Jack and<lb/> Jean wanted me
               to go to the pictures with<lb/> them but as they were going to see <name><title
                  type="film">Gert and<lb/> Daisy</title></name> I declined the invitation.</p>
            <p>I’ve moved my belongings into room 13<lb/> and find it’s a delightful room with a
               nice<lb/> thick carpet which is much better than the<lb/> thin, loose mats to which
               you and I have<lb/> been used to hitherto. No doubt John<lb/> and I will do much
               talking about Ruby<lb/> and ______ (well don’t be surprised if you ears<lb/> burn a
               bit, too).</p>
            <p>There was a letter here for Poppy.<lb/> Mr. Henderson and I were re-addressing them
               and it’s<lb/> been sent on to your house; your address was<lb/> the one given in the
               visitors book; remember?<lb/> You will be able to pass it on to Poppy.<lb/> You might

            </p>
            <p>I ought to have said this morning,<lb/> ‘Thanks for helping to make my week’s

               Thank you ever so much for the<lb/> nice letter which you sent me. It<lb/> was good of you to write so soon.<lb/> I, too, must say that it has been<lb/> the most delightful holiday I have<lb/> ever spent, and would express<lb/> my sincere thanks for the very<lb/> happy times which we had<lb/> together.<lb/> </p>
               
             <p>  I have been into the office,<lb/> and have now got settled down<lb/> somewhat, but all the same,<lb/> I can’t help wishing I was<lb/> back at Dhalling Mhor!<lb/> </p> <pb facs="xxx"/> <!-- insert page picture -->
               
             <metamark place="top" function="pageNumber">2.</metamark> <p> We were late arriving in Manchester<lb/> on Saturday. We got in about 7.0.<lb/> instead of 5.0. You were quite<lb/> right in supposing that it would<lb/> be raining. It certainly was, and<lb/> I do not think it has stopped<lb/>
                 since.<lb/> </p> 
               
              <p> I received Poppy’s letter here,<lb/> and have forwarded it on to<lb/> her, thank you.<lb/></p> 
               
              <p> I am sending you a photograph,<lb/> which was recently taken, if you<lb/> care to have it, as I think it is<lb/> a bit better than the one we<lb/> had taken at Dunoon?<lb/> </p>
               
               <p>Enclosed you will find my  £ 3.,<lb/> as I cannot spend them here<lb/> without losing on them (I have<lb/> cultivated the Scotch habit, haven’t I?)<lb/> </p> <pb facs="xxx"/> <!-- insert page image -->

              <p> If ever you are in Manchester<lb/> before then, do not hesitate to go<lb/> into the Central Hall and see<lb/> Dad, as I am sure he will<lb/> be pleased to meet you.<lb/></p> 
               
              <p> I have been looking at the<lb/> photograph of Swanwick - 1939 -<lb/> and notice both you and Dad<lb/> on it, so, no doubt, you<lb/> will recognise him when<lb/> you see him.<lb/></p> <pb facs="xxx"/><!-- insert page image -->

              <p> I trust the weather will improve.<lb/> Please give my kind regards<lb/> to Jack and Jean, Harry &amp; Ellie,<lb/> and, of course, John.

         <p>
            Received your letter today and was<lb/> very pleased indeed to get it. Thanks for<lb/> the photograph, it’s really lovely and I do<lb/> appreciate it very much. When I get back<lb/> to Stockport it will have an honoured place<lb/> in my study where I shall see it often<lb/> to remind me of you and of our friendship. <lb/></p>
            
           <p>I have changed the 3 Scotch<lb/> notes for English ones; herewith enclosed. You<lb/> don’t say that I should return them but<lb/> I am presuming I should. <lb/></p>
            
            <p>This week has been much<lb/> different from last in many ways. First and<lb/><pb facs="xxx"/> <!-- insert page image here --> foremost - you are not here; then the weather <lb/>has been awfully bad until today; these<lb/> things have tended to make me a bit fed<lb/> up. We have not been able to get out<lb/> much and you will realise that being in<lb/> here day after day aimlessly whiling away<lb/> the time is not a good thing. I have<lb/> slept much and played cards a bit and<lb/> in between the showers and, on occasion, in<lb/> the showers have walked out with Harry or<lb/> Ellie or <!-- insert tage for unclear word for rather -->rather Davies and Nora who has<lb/> linked herself to him.<lb/></p>
               
               <p>On Monday we did Rothesay again.<lb/> The sail was most exhilarating. The Clyde<lb/> was ‘choppy’ and the boat tossed quite a<lb/> bit and took showers over the bow. There<lb/> were some heavy showers of rain, too, but<lb/><pb facs="xxx"/><!-- insert page image here -->

                 we didn’t get very wet. After lunch we climbed<lb/> Barone hill, where I gathered the heather I<lb/> sent you - which incidentally I hope you<lb/> received unsquashed and smelling of the hills -<lb/> and where we saw something of the rugged<lb/> nature of the hills lying behind Rothesay. We<lb/> saw Arran rising from the mists as the<lb/> strong winds sent them swirling round the hills.<lb/> The demoralising walk back from Innellan I <lb/>did by myself and wearily climbed Clyde Street<lb/> after a buffeting day.<lb/></p>
                  
                  <p>On Tuesday, in the rain, a few of<lb/> us went to Killcraigon and walked about<lb/> five or six miles to Loch Long. The concert <lb/>in the evening was not bad but was not<lb/> so good as last week’s. Wednesday was<lb/><pb facs="xxxx"/><!-- insert page image --> rather a miserable day. We had showers<lb/> throughout the day and after playing bowls in<lb/> the tournament I had an hour and a<lb/> half lying on my bed. In the evening<lb/> nearly everybody went to the Cosy Corner so<lb/> four of us - Mrs. Henderson, Mrs. Rawlinson and<lb/> Joan and I played <!-- tag for a game name -->“Kan - U - Go”; a card<lb/> game but not an exciting one, I’m afraid.<lb/></p>
                  
                  <p>Today, Thursday, has been much better.<lb/> The sun has shone gloriously and we have<lb/> had a fine excursion to Loch Eck and<lb/> Ardentinny. We walked along the side of<lb/> the Loch to Whistlefield where we had lunch<lb/> and then over the hills to Ardentinny. The<lb/> scenery beggars description; it is absolutely<lb/> exquisite - the strong, silent hills contrasted<lb/> beautifully with the wooded, flowery valleys;<lb/> and from time to time one caught a glimpse<lb/><pb facs="xxx"/> <!-- insert page image here- scan 14 -->

I must have a look<lb/> at it when I come to the ‘do’ next month.<lb/> The 12th will be quite all right for me<lb/> and I shall look forward to seeing<lb/> you and your parents then. It would<lb/><pb facs="xxx"/><!-- insert page image - scan 15 --> be jolly nice to see you before then and<lb/> if you have a Saturday afternoon free in<lb/> a fortnight’s time maybe you’ll let me<lb/> know and we could fix a re-union in<lb/> the City somewhere.<lb/></p>
