            <p><placeName>Dhalling Mhor</placeName> doesn’t seem like <placeName>Dhalling <lb/> Mhor</placeName> now you are not here. You had
               become so <lb/> much a part of the life here, so far as I was <lb/> concerned, that
               things seem a bit dead now<lb/> you have gone.</p>
            <p>By this time you will be at home<lb/> or very near home (time six o’clock) and
               looking mournfully at the weather; it’s bound to be raining<lb/> in <placeName>Manchester</placeName> as it
               is here still. You have been<lb/> much in my thoughts as you made the beastly<lb/>
               railway journey and I kept saying to myself, “They<lb/> will have reached <placeName>Glasgow</placeName>
               now; they will be on the<lb/> <choice><abbr>M/C</abbr><expan>Manchester</expan></choice>train now.”</p>
            <p> I can’t say how much I’ve missed<lb/> you today. I’ve wondered round a bit on my own,<lb/>
               <pb facs="xxx"/><!-- enter correct page here --> and played cards a bit with the
               older generation,<lb/> and slept a bit. <persName>Harry</persName> and <persName>Ellie</persName>, <persName>Jack</persName> and<lb/> <persName>Jean</persName> wanted me
               to go to the pictures with<lb/> them but as they were going to see <title

            <p>I’ve moved my belongings into room 13<lb/> and find it’s a delightful room with a
               nice<lb/> thick carpet which is much better than the<lb/> thin, loose mats to which
               you and I have<lb/> been used to hitherto. No doubt <persName>John</persName><lb/> and I will do much
               talking about <persName>Ruby</persName><lb/> and ______ (well don’t be surprised if your ears<lb/> burn a

            <p>There was a letter here for <persName>Poppy</persName>.<lb/> <persName>Mr. Henderson</persName>and I were re-addressing them

            <p> Thank you ever so much for the<lb/> nice letter which you sent me. It<lb/> was good
               of you to write so soon.<lb/> I, too, must say that it has been<lb/> the most
               delightful holiday I have<lb/> ever spent, and would express<lb/> my sincere thanks
               for the very<lb/> happy times which we had<lb/> together.<lb/>
            </p>

            <p> I have been into the office,<lb/> and have now got settled down<lb/> somewhat, but
               all the same,<lb/> I can’t help wishing I was<lb/> back at <placeName>Dhalling Mhor</placeName>!<lb/>

            <p> We were late arriving in <placeName>Manchester</placeName><lb/> on Saturday. We got in about <time when="19:00:00">7.0</time>.<lb/>
               instead of <time when="17:00:00">5.0</time>. You were quite<lb/> right in supposing that it would<lb/> be raining.
               It certainly was, and<lb/> I do not think it has stopped<lb/> since.<lb/>
            </p>

            <p> I received <persName>Poppy’s</persName> letter here,<lb/> and have forwarded it on to<lb/> her, thank
               you.<lb/></p>

            <p> I am sending you a photograph,<lb/> which was recently taken, if you<lb/> care to
               have it, as I think it is<lb/> a bit better than the one we<lb/> had taken at
               <placeName>Dunoon</placeName>?<lb/>
            </p>

            <p>Enclosed you will find my <measure type="currency">£ 3.</measure>,<lb/> as I cannot spend them here<lb/> without losing
               on them (I have<lb/> cultivated the Scotch habit, haven’t I?)<lb/>

            <p> Perhaps we could have the<lb/> 21st “do”on the <date when="1942-09-12">12th September</date>, if<lb/> this will be
               convenient to you.<lb/> However, let me know, and then<lb/> we can fix it.<lb/></p>

               for<lb/> the photograph, it’s really lovely and I do<lb/> appreciate it very much.

               <lb/>has been awfully bad until today; these<lb/> things have tended to make me a bit
               fed<lb/> up. We have not been able to get out<lb/> much and you will realise that
               being in<lb/> here day after day aimlessly whiling away<lb/> the time is not a good
               thing. I have<lb/> slept much and played cards a bit and<lb/> in between the showers
               and, on occasion, in<lb/> the showers have walked out with <persName>Harry</persName> or<lb/> <persName>Ellie</persName> or
               <unclear reason="illegible">rather</unclear> <persName>Davies</persName> and <persName>Nora</persName> who has<lb/>
               linked herself to him.<lb/></p>

            <p>On Monday we did <placeName>Rothesay</placeName> again.<lb/> The sail was most exhilarating. <name type="river">The Clyde</name><lb/>
               was <q>‘choppy’</q> and the boat tossed quite a<lb/> bit and took showers over the bow.
               There<lb/> were some heavy showers of rain, too, but<lb/>

               we
               didn’t get very wet. After lunch we climbed<lb/> <name>Barone hill</name>, where I gathered the
               heather I<lb/> sent you - which incidentally I hope you<lb/> received unsquashed and
               smelling of the hills -<lb/> and where we saw something of the rugged<lb/> nature of
               the hills lying behind <placeName>Rothesay</placeName>. We<lb/> saw <name>Arran</name> rising from the mists as the<lb/>
               strong winds sent them swirling round the hills.<lb/> The demoralising walk back from
               <placeName>Innellan</placeName> I <lb/>did by myself and wearily climbed <name type="street">Clyde Street</name><lb/> after a buffeting
               day.<lb/></p>

            <p>On Tuesday, in the rain, a few of<lb/> us went to <placeName>Killcraigon</placeName> and walked about<lb/>
               five or six miles to <placeName>Loch Long</placeName>. The concert <lb/>in the evening was not bad but was
               not<lb/> so good as last week’s. Wednesday was<lb/><pb facs="xxxx"
               /><!-- insert page image --> rather a miserable day. We had showers<lb/> throughout
               the day and after playing bowls in<lb/> the tournament I had an hour and a<lb/> half
               lying on my bed. In the evening<lb/> nearly everybody went to the Cosy Corner so<lb/>
               four of us - <persName>Mrs. Henderson</persName>, <persName>Mrs. Rawlinson</persName> and<lb/> <persName>Joan </persName>and I played
            <name type="game"><q>“Kan - U - Go”</q></name>; a card<lb/> game but not an exciting one,
               I’m afraid.<lb/></p>

            <p>Today, Thursday, has been much better.<lb/> The sun has shone gloriously and we
               have<lb/> had a fine excursion to <placeName>Loch Eck</placeName> and<lb/> <placeName>Ardentinny</placeName>. We walked along the
               side of<lb/> the Loch to <placeName>Whistlefield</placeName> where we had lunch<lb/> and then over the hills
               to <placeName>Ardentinny</placeName>. The<lb/> scenery beggars description; it is absolutely<lb/> exquisite
               - the strong, silent hills contrasted<lb/> beautifully with the wooded, flowery
               valleys;<lb/> and from time to time one caught a glimpse<lb/><pb facs="xxx"/>

            <p>Very many thanks for your<lb/> letter, which I was pleased to<lb/> receive. I am
               simply delighted<lb/> to think that our friendship is<lb/> still going to continue,
               and<lb/> I hope we shall have very<lb/> many happy times together.<lb/></p>
            <p>It was good of you to spare<lb/> a few minutes to write to me<lb/> on Sunday, as I
               know how <lb/>busy you must have been,<lb/> and I do appreciate it Jim.<lb/> It is
               Morris’ last Sunday next<lb/> week.<lb/></p>

            <p>Our new minister, who is coming<lb/> in September, the one
               from<lb/><!-- place name tag? --> Headingley College, is named<lb/> “Rees”. Dad had a
               letter from<lb/> him, and I understand he<lb/> lives in Cardiff.<lb/></p>

            <p>I think Margaret and I<lb/> are going to the Paramount to see<lb/> “How Green was my
               Valley”,<!-- title tag? --> as<lb/> it is supposed to be such a<lb/> good
               film.<lb/></p>

            <p>On Wednesday, I am going<lb/> with the Platt Lane League<lb/> to Hartley College,
               where some<lb/> of them are playing in a <lb/>tennis tournament. Needless<lb/> to
               say, I am not playing tennis.<lb/></p>

            <p>It would certainly have been<lb/> lovely if we could have had<lb/> our full
               fortnight’s holiday<lb/> together Jim, but still it<lb/> was grand to have had a<lb/>
               week, wasn’t it.<lb/></p>

            <p>I am so glad you like<lb/> Mother and Dad, as I am sure<lb/> they will always make
               you very<lb/> welcome. Mother suggested that<lb/> on Saturday, we may as well<lb/>
               come back hometo tea, as it<lb/> would be better than having<lb/> to get it out
               somewhere.<lb/></p>

            <p>Perhaps you would like me<lb/> to show you where Platt Church<lb/> is, as it would be

            <p> It was a great joy to me to receive your letter<lb/> yesterday afternoon but a
               greater joy to read in it, ‘I am simply<lb/> delighted to think that our friendship
               is still going to continue’.<lb/> It gives me a greater joy <del type="strikethrough"
                  >that</del> than I can express in words<lb/> that both of us should feel so much
               in accord. When there<lb/> is a true spirit of reciprocity between two people then
               those two<lb/> are happy indeed; and, I trust, that the spirit of reciprocity<lb/>
               that exists between us will grow stronger and deeper.<lb/></p>

            <p>Sunday was a busy day but I was not<lb/> too busy to write because, in a sense, one
               feels in writing<lb/> that one is in the presence of and actually speaking to
               the<lb/> person concerned. That is how I feel about writing to<lb/> you. In the
               evening on Sunday I was disconcerted<lb/> to find <!-- person name tag -->W. C.
               Jackson, who, as you know, is an ex-president<lb/> of the Conference and very able
               preacher, in the congregation<lb/>
               <pb facs="xxx"/>
               <!-- insert page here - scan 24 --> at Bramhall and I was rather ‘nervy’ as I took
               the<lb/> service. However, God blessed us and we had a great time.<lb/> I spent an
               hour with Mr. &amp; Mrs. Harold Darly on Sunday<lb/> evening poring over a map of
               Scotland and pointing out<lb/> the places I had visited.<lb/></p>

            <p> On Monday I made the journey to Wrexham and<lb/> returned yesterday. Last night
               there was a good crowd at<lb/> my class and we had a very good meeting. I<lb/> didn’t
               know that “How Green was my Valley”<!-- title tag? --> was in
               Manchester<!-- placename tag? -->.<lb/> It is reputed to be the finest picture of the
               year. I<lb/> hope to see it, too, when I get the opportunity.<lb/></p>


            <p>It’s jolly good of your mother to suggest we<lb/> should have tea at your house on
               Saturday. We shall<lb/> accept the invitation, shan’t we? I was going to<lb/> suggest
               going out to Styal<!-- placename tag? --> by train and having a<lb/> walk there and
               tea at some friends of mine but we'll<lb/> do that some other Saturday.<lb/></p>


            <p>I shall have to leave this letter now as I<lb/>
               <pb facs="xxx"/><!-- insert page image - scan 25 --> have an appointment at 2-30 and
               it’s already 2.20. So<lb/> until Saturday every good wish. My thoughts are

               Stockport<!-- place name tag? --><lb/> in spite of the fact that I missed the last
               bus from town on Saturday.<lb/> Any little fear was worth suffering, however, for the
               walk back to your<lb/> house from Hardings. The bus I jumped onto at the end of<lb/>
               Cranboure Rd. was no good to me at all and the conductress put<lb/> me off when we
               got round the corner into Wilbraham Road. I<lb/> went into a doorway to shelter from
               the drizzle and asked a person<lb/> there if he knew what time there would be an
               eighty bus. Instead<lb/> of answering my question he said, “Don’t you work at
               —------?” (I<lb/> forget the name). “No”, I replied, “I don’t”. “You’re very<lb/>
               much like a man I know who works there”. “Really!”<lb/> “You caught a bus here last
               week, didn’t you?” “Yes, I<lb/> did. It seems like a case of once I’m seen, I am
               never<lb/> forgotten.” “Oh!” he replied, “I noticed the resemblance last<lb/> week.
               Hasn’t your young lady come to see you off tonight?”<lb/> “I got on round the
               corner”, I snapped, “what time will<lb/> there be an eighty bus?” Who he was I don’t
               know<lb/> because he moved away very soon after without much more
               conversation.<lb/></p>
            <pb facs="xxx"/>
            <!-- insert page image - scan 27 -->

            <p>On reaching town I found that the last bus had<lb/> gone and so made my way to London
               Road station and by the<lb/> skin of my teeth managed to get the eleven o’clock
               train<lb/> as it was moving out of the station. I think in<lb/> future I will use the
               train; it is much more reliable. I<lb/> was in doors here soon after 11-30, so it
               wasn’t bad.<lb/></p>

            <p> I hope you had good services at Platt Lane<lb/> yesterday and that you will have a
               good farewell meeting<lb/> tonight. My services were very good on the whole. I had
               Edgar<lb/> Roberts, the minister at Hazel Grove, in my congregation in the
               morning.<lb/> He is on holiday but at home.<lb/></p>

            <p>Could you see the flares from Chorlton last night? They<lb/> were very near here and
               looked most picturesque.<lb/></p>

            <p>If it should rain next Saturday (I hope it<lb/> will not, but if it should - ) maybe
               we could arrange to see a<lb/> picture or something. Anyway I’ll come down wet or
               fine and<lb/> we’ll cycle to Styal<!-- place name tag --> if it’s fine. I will get in
               touch with<lb/> the Henshalls during the week. I am waiting now for next<lb/>
               Saturday. With my love, Doreen,<lb/></p>

            </opener>
            <p> It was delightful to get your letter yesterday with its various<lb/> items of news.
               I had looked forward to receiving it, but shall look<lb/> forward with greater
               eagerness to seeing you on Saturday. I will<lb/> leave here on my bicycle at 1-30
               but, as I don’t know how<lb/> long the journey to your house will take, I cannot
               say<lb/> definitely what time I shall arrive. I ought to do it in<lb/> just under an
               hour, I should think. We’ll enjoy ourselves<lb/> tremendously if it’s a decent day.
               Styal<!-- place name tag? --> is a lovely little spot<lb/> and the woods are the
               property of the Society which preserves our<lb/> beauty spots.<lb/></p>

            <p>The Dhalling Mhor friends have been doing quite a lof of<lb/> corresponding. Dear old
               Connie with her ‘dears’ and ‘loves’ is quite a<lb/> character. Ruby would think she
               was telling you ‘news’ when she<lb/> imparted the information relating to
               me.<lb/></p>

            <p>After reading about the Farewell meeting I almost wished<lb/> I was having one too.
               But I shouldn’t like to think that<lb/> I was moving a good distance away from this
               district. You and<lb/> I, Doreen, are fortunate; we might have lived miles away from
               each<lb/> other.<lb/></p>

            <p>The Hardings seem delightful people. They are generous<lb/> with Sir Walter Scott. I
               must make some arrangements regarding those<lb/> books and get them out of their way.
               Where I shall<lb/> put them here I don’t know yet but I shall find some<lb/> place
               for them even at the risk of incurring my landlady’s<lb/> wrath.<lb/></p>

            <p>I have a funeral this morning and the interment is<lb/> out at New Mills which means
               that I shall not get back for<lb/> dinner until about 1-15. One good thing: I have
               not to<lb/> walk to the house for the service; the undertaker is sending a<lb/> taxi
               - good man! Tonight, as I have no meeting, I<lb/> shall have to settle down to
               sermonizing. Sunday’s sermon is<lb/> not yet prepared and, as it has got to be a
               special one,<lb/> I must get down to it seriously. I am going to<lb/> take as my
               text: “Let us build with you: for we seek your<lb/> God, as ye do….. Ye have nothing
               to do with us to build<lb/> a house unto our God.” <!-- quotation tag? --> I had my
               subject announced<lb/> last Sunday - Building Together.<lb/></p>

            <p> I trust that without any mishap you arrived home<lb/> safely last night. It was
               lovely to have you see the mission<lb/> and hear me preach and I hope you were not
               disappointed<lb/> in either.<lb/></p>

            <p>Ever since I met you at Dhalling Mhor I have<lb/> had a high regard for you but
               having more opportunities of meeting<lb/> you since Dhalling Mhor days my regard has
               deepend into<lb/> much more. I want you to know, Doreen, that I love you<lb/> with
               all my heart. You are the most beautiful, sweetest girl<lb/> I have ever met and if I
               didn’t love you I should feel<lb/> that I was a creature without feeling. Every
               moment of every<lb/> day I am thinking about you and when I am with you<lb/> that is
               ecstasy par excellence. This is not being said<lb/> lightly; Doreen, it is deep and
               sincere. That is why I am<lb/> expressing it to you first on paper. It is not
               always<lb/> easy for one to say in words what one feels in one’s<lb/> heart and
               although I intended saying this into your ear<lb/>
               <pb facs="xxxx"/><!-- insert page image - scan 35 --> yet the right psychological
               moment didn’t seem to present itself.<lb/> But I wanted you to know what I felt in my
               heart<lb/> before we see each other again; I could not wait for next<lb/>
               Saturday.<lb/></p>

            <p>And now I shall await your next letter to find,<lb/> I hope, that this feeling of
               love is reciprocal. What<lb/> things you and I, Doreen, can do together!
               Everything<lb/> seems different to me. Do you know the hymn - Loved with<lb/>
               everlasting love <!-- title tag? -->- 443? That hymn expresses what I feel.<lb/></p>


            <p>I find I am living from week-end to week-end<lb/> eagerly anticipating each Saturday.
               And I am so proud to<lb/> introduce you to my friends.<lb/></p>

            <p> Mrs. Bithell, who saw you with Mrs. Bransly, is annoyed<lb/> because she wasn’t
               introduced. I placated her this morning when<lb/> she poured out her grievance by
               promising her that she would<lb/> meet you soon.<lb/></p>

            <p>This weekend will for ever<lb/> live in my memory, dear.<lb/> I enjoyed evey minute
               of it.<lb/> It was funny you should mention <lb/> hymn 443, as I was thinking<lb/>
               about that on Sunday. I remember<lb/> once learning all the words<lb/> off by heart.
               It is such a <lb/> beautiful hymn, and can express<lb/> one’s feelings far better
               than<lb/> words could ever do. <lb/></p>

            <p> I am sure we shall have such <lb/> wonderful times together, Jim. <lb/></p>

            <p> It seems so strange that we<lb/> should live so near, and yet<lb/> have to meet so
               far away as <lb/> Scotland, but I am sure there<lb/>

            <p> Do let me know what size<lb/> gaiters you want. They have<lb/> them in 26” - 30”
               <!-- measurement tag? -->length. <lb/></p>
            <p> I called in to-day for your<lb/> book, but it hadn’t come in,<lb/> so I will go
               again later in the week. <lb/></p>

            <p>I am so much looking forward<lb/> to seeing you on Saturday.<lb/></p>

               well, that was nothing compared to the way<lb/> in which I reacted to the reading of
               your letter. It’s<lb/> absolutely great, Doreen. No words can explain the ecstasy
               or<lb/> the delight I feel in my heart. I love you and you love me -<lb/> two folks
               feeling alike and having in common our love for<lb/> our Lord Jesus Christ. All love
               comes from God; it’s Divine and<lb/> I can hardly wait for Saturday because then,
               when we’re together,<lb/> our love can be communicated in a way that pen and ink
               can<lb/> never communicate it. You are the grandest, finest, sweetest<lb/> girl in
               the world, Doreen; and I can hardly believe my good<lb/> fortune to be true. But it
               is, and as you say there must<lb/> be some Divine purpose behind it all.<lb/></p>

            <p>Just before going to Dhalling Mhor my work was<lb/> getting on top of me; I had
               worked hard and I was tired; but<lb/> I was rather unhappy, too. I can’t explain it
               properly but<lb/>
               <pb facs="xxx"/><!-- insert page image - scan 43 --> it seemed as though I were
               struggling alone. People so often<lb/> didn’t understand; they let me down badly on
               occasion. All<lb/> that is altered now. I shall always think Dhalling Mhor<lb/> a
               blessed spot and I shall always remember the first<lb/> Sunday morning at breakfast
               when I asked (goodness knows<lb/> why!) if there were any folks at the table from
               Machester.<lb/> Remember? <lb/></p>

            <p> I am so glad you enjoyed your swim. Thanks for<lb/> calling for the book<del
                  type="strikethrough">s</del>. And thanks awfully for bothering about<lb/> the cape
               and leggings. It’s so good of your Dad to let<lb/> me have his coupons (your mother
               and father have been wonderfully<lb/> kind to me). I’ve tried to measure my leg- not
               very<lb/> successfully, I’m afraid - and I think I had better have<lb/> the 30”.
               <lb/></p>

            <p> One thing that I think might go down well at<lb/> your party, Doreen, is a little
               play for two people supposed<lb/> to be broadcasting. It’s done in the dark and the
               two<lb/> folks read from behind a screen or curtain. I’ve done it once<lb/> and we
               found it very good. I’ll get hold of the<lb/> book for Saturday and then you can see
               it. I might<lb/> sing - then again, I might not - “If you want a bit o’Lancashire<lb/>
               <pb facs="xxx"/><!-- insert page image - scan 44 --> we know where it is”. Joking
               aside; I’ll ransack my<lb/> brains and try and dig up some other ideas. What about
               a<lb/> beetle drive? I’ll bring my papers and dice if you decide on<lb/> it. Beetle
               always makes good entertainment. <lb/></p>

            <p> I have had a letter from Mr. Bransly today in which<lb/> he says among other things,
               “I also heard from Home that you are<lb/> going there for tea tonight. Well I shall
               be thinking of you<lb/> and wishing I were with you. I hope you all have a jolly
               good<lb/> tea, and I suppose you will excell yourself tonight at
               preaching”.<lb/><!-- quotation tag? --> Everything is all right for a week next
               Sunday, I hope, Doreen.<lb/> We’ll have a good day then but a better the day<lb/>
               before.<lb/></p>

            <p>This afternoon I have had a funeral and my<lb/> Ladies’ class at Offerton and tonight
               I am attending an interviewing<lb/> committee in connection with the Youth Movement.
               This beginning<lb/> of the Connexional year is always a busy time but I love it.<lb/>
               I revel in circuit meetings; in talking to folks from different<lb/> Churches; in
               having fellowship with the ministers of the staff; and<lb/> I know you love it, too.
               On Friday we have a staff<lb/> meeting at five; tea at six; and a stewards’
               meeting<lb/> after tea. The circuit stewards are always welcomed into the<lb/>
               <pb facs="xxx"/><!-- insert page image - scan 45 --> staff meeting for a moment when
               they hand out little<lb/> envelopes containing quarterly cheques. Methodism is
               wonderful<lb/> and I am very proud to be able to serve her as a<lb/> minister. There
               can be nothing higher in life. <lb/></p>

            <closer>
               <salute>Every little bit of me says, “I love you”. <lb/> God bless you, Doreen,<lb/>
