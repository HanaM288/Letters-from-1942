# Yours very sincerely, ... A Digital Compilation of Letters from 1942

This is a digitisation project that has been carried out as part of the Digitising Culture Heritage Materials course at the University of BorÃ¥s. We were tasked with carrying out a digitisation project through all stages from material selection and planning to publication. The collection comprises 11 letters written in August and September 1942 between two young people in their twenties in England during World War II. The 11 letters chosen for this project are a sample of a much bigger collection of letters and sermons. The letters span from 1942 until the early 1950s after the end of the war. The collection gives in an insight into communication in daily life in a pre-digital era during a pivotal time in world history.
