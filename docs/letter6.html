                  <p>   My Dear Doreen,</p>
                     
                     
                     <p> You will see from the address that I am back in
                        Stockport<br> in spite of the fact that I missed the last
                        bus from town on Saturday.<br> Any little fear was worth suffering, however, for the
                        walk back to your<br> house from Hardings. The bus I jumped onto at the end of<br>
                         Cranboure Rd. was no good to me at all and the conductress put<br> me off when we
                        got round the corner into Wilbraham Road. I<br> went into a doorway to shelter from
                        the drizzle and asked a person<br> there if he knew what time there would be an
                        eighty bus. Instead<br> of answering my question he said, “Don’t you work at
                        —------?” (I<br> forget the name). “No”, I replied, “I don’t”. “You’re very<br>
                        much like a man I know who works there”. “Really!”<br> “You caught a bus here last
                        week, didn’t you?” “Yes, I<br> did. It seems like a case of once I’m seen, I am
                        never<br> forgotten.” “Oh!” he replied, “I noticed the resemblance last<br> week.
                        Hasn’t your young lady come to see you off tonight?”<br> “I got on round the
                        corner”, I snapped, “what time will<br> there be an eighty bus?” Who he was I don’t
                        know<br> because he moved away very soon after without much more
                        conversation.<br></p>

                     <br>
                     <p>On reaching town I found that the last bus had<br> gone and so made my way to London
                        Road station and by the<br> skin of my teeth managed to get the eleven o’clock
                        train<br> as it was moving out of the station. I think in<br> future I will use the
                        train; it is much more reliable. I<br> was in doors here soon after 11-30, so it
                        wasn’t bad.<br></p>
                     
                     
                     <p> I hope you had good services at Platt Lane<br> yesterday and that you will have a
                        good farewell meeting<br> tonight. My services were very good on the whole. I had
                         Edgar<br> Roberts, the minister at Hazel Grove, in my congregation in the
                        morning.<br> He is on holiday but at home.<br></p>
                     
                     
                     <p>Could you see the flares from Chorlton last night? They<br> were very near here and
                        looked most picturesque.<br></p>
                     
                     
                     <p>If it should rain next Saturday (I hope it<br> will not, but if it should - ) maybe
                        we could arrange to see a<br> picture or something. Anyway I’ll come down wet or
                        fine and<br> we’ll cycle to Styalif it’s fine. I will get in
                        touch with<br> the Henshalls during the week. I am waiting now for next<br>
                        Saturday. With my love, Doreen,<br></p>
                     
                    <p> Yours affectionately,<br>
