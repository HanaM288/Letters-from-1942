                        My dear Jim,
                        
                        
                        
                        <p>It was simply wonderful to<br> receive your letter this morning.<br> I am so happy
                           to think that we<br> have so much in common. I do<br> love you with all my heart
                            Jim,<br> and I am so delighted to know<br> that you feel the same towards me.<br>
                           I am always thinking about you,<br> and I am so proud to think<br> you are doing
                           such a great<br> work, which is the greatest<br> thing in life. <br></p>

                        <p>This weekend will for ever<br> live in my memory, dear.<br> I enjoyed evey minute
                           of it.<br> It was funny you should mention <br> hymn 443, as I was thinking<br>
                           about that on Sunday. I remember<br> once learning all the words<br> off by heart.
                           It is such a <br> beautiful hymn, and can express<br> one’s feelings far better
                           than<br> words could ever do. <br></p>
                        
                        
                        <p> I am sure we shall have such <br> wonderful times together, Jim. <br></p>
                        
                        
                        <p> It seems so strange that we<br> should live so near, and yet<br> have to meet so
                           far away as <br> Scotland, but I am sure there<br>
                           
                           3. 
                           must be some divine purpose<br> behind
                           it all. <br></p>
                        
                        
                        <p> Do let me know what size<br> gaiters you want. They have<br> them in 26” - 30”
                           length. <br></p>
                        
                        <p> I called in to-day for your<br> book, but it hadn’t come in,<br> so I will go
                           again later in the week. <br></p>
                        
                        
                        <p>We had a grand swim<br> yesterday, although it was a<br> bit cold on first getting

                           following Saturday please let<br> me know, as I am trying to<br> plan my
                           programme.<br></p>
                        
                        
                        <p> I do love you more than<br> anything else Jim; do believe<br> this, from the
                           bottom<br> of my heart. <br></p>
