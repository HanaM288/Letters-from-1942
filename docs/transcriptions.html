                     My Dear Doreen,
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>Dhalling Mhor doesn’t seem like Dhalling  Mhor now you are not here. You had
                        become so  much a part of the life here, so far as I was  concerned, that
                        things seem a bit dead now you have gone.</p>
                     
                     <p>By this time you will be at home or very near home (time six o’clock) and
                        looking mournfully at the weather; it’s bound to be raining in Manchester as it
                        is here still. You have been much in my thoughts as you made the beastly
                        railway journey and I kept saying to myself, “They will have reached Glasgow
                        now; they will be on the M/CManchestertrain now.”</p>
                     
                     <p> I can’t say how much I’ve missed you today. I’ve wondered round a bit on my own,
                         and played cards a bit with the
                        older generation, and slept a bit. Harry and Ellie, Jack and Jean wanted me
                        to go to the pictures with them but as they were going to see Gert and Daisy I declined the invitation.</p>
                     
                     <p>I’ve moved my belongings into room 13 and find it’s a delightful room with a
                        nice thick carpet which is much better than the thin, loose mats to which
                        you and I have been used to hitherto. No doubt John and I will do much
                        talking about Ruby and ______ (well don’t be surprised if your ears burn a
                        bit, too).</p>
                     
                     <p>There was a letter here for Poppy. Mr. Hendersonand I were re-addressing them
                        and it’s been sent on to your house; your address was the one given in the
                        visitors book; remember? You will be able to pass it on to Poppy. You might
                        note  that the stamp is placed

                     <p>Let me know, Doreen, how you got along today. You know, surely, that I
                        shall always be glad to hear from you and don’t forget the tea. I looked in
                        my diary and found that Sept. 7th. is the date of the Harvest Festival
                        Lecture at the mission so please stear clear of that date, won’t you?
                        I shall count the days to Sept. with keen anticipation. Don’t do too much
                        work next week if you don’t feel like it; I’ll give you permission to
                        
                         slack but don’t let the boss see you. Think of
                        me on the hills (that’s where I shan’t be if it keeps raining).

                     <p>I ought to have said this morning, ‘Thanks for helping to make my week’s
                        stay at Dhalling Mhor such a happy one.’ This second week will not be as
                        happy as the first, I know. Do accept my thanks, now. I feel so glad that
                        the week afforded to us the opportunity of each other’s company &amp; I
                        hope we shall continue the friendship.

                     My dear Jim,
                     
                     
                     <p> Thank you ever so much for the nice letter which you sent me. It was good
                        of you to write so soon. I, too, must say that it has been the most
                        delightful holiday I have ever spent, and would express my sincere thanks
                        for the very happy times which we had together.
                        </p>
                     
                     
                     <p> I have been into the office, and have now got settled down somewhat, but
                        all the same, I can’t help wishing I was back at Dhalling Mhor!
                        </p>
                     
                     
                     
                     2.
                     
                     <p> We were late arriving in Manchester on Saturday. We got in about 7.0.
                        instead of 5.0. You were quite right in supposing that it would be raining.
                        It certainly was, and I do not think it has stopped since.
                        </p>
                     
                     
                     <p> I received Poppy’s letter here, and have forwarded it on to her, thank
                        you.</p>
                     
                     
                     <p> I am sending you a photograph, which was recently taken, if you care to
                        have it, as I think it is a bit better than the one we had taken at
                        Dunoon?
                        </p>
                     
                     
                     <p>Enclosed you will find my £ 3., as I cannot spend them here without losing
                        on them (I have cultivated the Scotch habit, haven’t I?)
                        </p>
                     
                     
                     
                     3.
                     
                     <p> Perhaps we could have the 21st “do”on the 12th September, if this will be
                        convenient to you. However, let me know, and then we can fix it.</p>
                     
                     
                     <p> If ever you are in Manchester before then, do not hesitate to go into the
                        Central Hall and see Dad, as I am sure he will be pleased to meet
                        you.</p>
                     
                     
                     <p> I have been looking at the photograph of Swanwick - 1939 - and notice both
                        you and Dad on it, so, no doubt, you will recognise him when you see
                        him.</p>
                     
                     
                     
                     4.
                     
                     <p> Well Jim! I do hope you have a really good holiday, and that you will feel
                        much better for it when you come back.</p>
                     
                     
                     <p> I trust the weather will improve. Please give my kind regards to Jack and
                        Jean, Harry &amp; Ellie, and, of course,John. Do not stay awake talking
                        all night, will you?</p>
                     
                     <p>Dad was enquiring about Ruby, and they said she will have to see a
                        specialist, as it will probably mean an operation.</p>
                     
                     All the very best, and hoping to see you soon. Yours very

                        for the photograph, it’s really lovely and I do appreciate it very much.
                        When I get back to Stockport it will have an honoured place in my study
                        where I shall see it often to remind me of you and of our friendship. </p>
                     
                     
                     <p>I have changed the 3 Scotch notes for English ones; herewith enclosed. You
                        don’t say that I should return them but I am presuming I should. </p>
                     
                     
                     <p>This week has been much different from last in many ways. First and
                         foremost - you are not here; then the weather
                        has been awfully bad until today; these things have tended to make me a bit
                        fed up. We have not been able to get out much and you will realise that
                        being in here day after day aimlessly whiling away the time is not a good
                        thing. I have slept much and played cards a bit and in between the showers
                        and, on occasion, in the showers have walked out with Harry or Ellie or
                        rather Davies and Nora who has
                        linked herself to him.</p>
                     
                     
                     <p>On Monday we did Rothesay again. The sail was most exhilarating. The Clyde
                        was ‘choppy’ and the boat tossed quite a bit and took showers over the bow.
                        There were some heavy showers of rain, too, but

                        we
                        didn’t get very wet. After lunch we climbed Barone hill, where I gathered the
                        heather I sent you - which incidentally I hope you received unsquashed and
                        smelling of the hills - and where we saw something of the rugged nature of
                        the hills lying behind Rothesay. We saw Arran rising from the mists as the
                        strong winds sent them swirling round the hills. The demoralising walk back from
                        Innellan I did by myself and wearily climbed Clyde Street after a buffeting
                        day.</p>
                     
                     
                     <p>On Tuesday, in the rain, a few of us went to Killcraigon and walked about
                        five or six miles to Loch Long. The concert in the evening was not bad but was
                        not so good as last week’s. Wednesday was rather a miserable day. We had showers throughout
                        the day and after playing bowls in the tournament I had an hour and a half
                        lying on my bed. In the evening nearly everybody went to the Cosy Corner so
                        four of us - Mrs. Henderson, Mrs. Rawlinson and Joan and I played
                        “Kan - U - Go”; a card game but not an exciting one,
                        I’m afraid.</p>
                     
                     
                     <p>Today, Thursday, has been much better. The sun has shone gloriously and we
                        have had a fine excursion to Loch Eck and Ardentinny. We walked along the
                        side of the Loch to Whistlefield where we had lunch and then over the hills
                        to Ardentinny. The scenery beggars description; it is absolutely exquisite
                        - the strong, silent hills contrasted beautifully with the wooded, flowery
                        valleys; and from time to time one caught a glimpse

                     <p>After all that talking about myself I’ll go back to your letter - it was good to
                        get it - and take up the points you make. I certainly will ‘drop’ into the
                        Central Hall and see you Dad whenever I’m in Manchester. After your
                        mentioning the photograph taken at Swanwick - 1939 - I remembered the details of
                        its being taken although I had forgotten about it and it’s very likely that
                        I should recognise your Dad. I must have a look at it when I come to the
                        ‘do’ next month. The 12th will be quite all right for me and I shall look
                        forward to seeing you and your parents then. It would be jolly nice to see you before then and
                        if you have a Saturday afternoon free in a fortnight’s time maybe you’ll let
                        me know and we could fix a re-union in the City somewhere.</p>
                     
                     
                     <p>I have passed on your good wishes to the people you mentioned. This week
                        will soon be over and the holiday ended, but it will have served it’s purpose
                        and I shall not be sorry to be back at my work; it’s the greatest a man
                        could do and I love it. Have you my Stockport address? It’s
                        22 Maitland St. Hempshaw Lane, Stockport. Do let me
                        have a letter soon, Doreen.</p>

                     <p>Very many thanks for your letter, which I was pleased to receive. I am
                        simply delighted to think that our friendship is still going to continue,
                        and I hope we shall have very many happy times together.</p>
                     
                     <p>It was good of you to spare a few minutes to write to me on Sunday, as I
                        know how busy you must have been, and I do appreciate it Jim. It is
                         Morris’ last Sunday next week.</p>

                        fromHeadingley College, is named “Rees”. Dad had a

                        where some of them are playing in a tennis tournament. Needless to
                        say, I am not playing tennis.</p>

                        week, wasn’t it.</p>

                        you very welcome. Mother suggested that on Saturday, we may as well
                        come back hometo tea, as it would be better than having to get it out
                        somewhere.</p>

                     My Dear Doreen,
                     
                     
                     <p> It was a great joy to me to receive your letter yesterday afternoon but a
                        greater joy to read in it, ‘I am simply delighted to think that our friendship
                        is still going to continue’. It gives me a greater joy <del>that</del> than I can express in words that both of us should feel so much
                        in accord. When there is a true spirit of reciprocity between two people then
                        those two are happy indeed; and, I trust, that the spirit of reciprocity
                        that exists between us will grow stronger and deeper.</p>
                     
                     
                     <p>Sunday was a busy day but I was not too busy to write because, in a sense, one
                        feels in writing that one is in the presence of and actually speaking to
                        the person concerned. That is how I feel about writing to you. In the
                        evening on Sunday I was disconcerted to find W. C.
                        Jackson, who, as you know, is an ex-president of the Conference and very able
                        preacher, in the congregation
                        
                         at Bramhall and I was rather ‘nervy’ as I took
                        the service. However, God blessed us and we had a great time. I spent an
                        hour with Mr. &amp; Mrs. Harold Darly on Sunday evening poring over a map of
                        Scotland and pointing out the places I had visited.</p>
                     
                     
                     <p> On Monday I made the journey to Wrexham and returned yesterday. Last night
                        there was a good crowd at my class and we had a very good meeting. I didn’t
                        know that “How Green was my Valley” was in
                         Manchester. It is reputed to be the finest picture of the
                        year. I hope to see it, too, when I get the opportunity.</p>
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>It’s jolly good of your mother to suggest we should have tea at your house on
                        Saturday. We shall accept the invitation, shan’t we? I was going to suggest
                        going out to Styalby train and having a walk there and
                        tea at some friends of mine but we'll do that some other Saturday.</p>
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>I shall have to leave this letter now as I
                         have an appointment at 2-30 and
                        it’s already 2.20. So until Saturday every good wish. My thoughts are
                        always with you, Doreen,</p>

                     <p>I had another letter from Connie this morning in which she thanks me for the
                        heather and in which she gives me a hearty welcome to Miss Rothwell’s flat
                        when I’m in Leeds. If Miss Rothwell gets everybody at her flat whom
                        she’s invited there I don’t suppose there’ll be room for them. We’ll go
                        sometime and give them a shock.</p>

                     August <u>24th</u>1942.
                     My Dear Doreen,
                     
                     
                     <p> You will see from the address that I am back in
                        Stockport in spite of the fact that I missed the last
                        bus from town on Saturday. Any little fear was worth suffering, however, for the
                        walk back to your house from Hardings. The bus I jumped onto at the end of
                         Cranboure Rd. was no good to me at all and the conductress put me off when we
                        got round the corner into Wilbraham Road. I went into a doorway to shelter from
                        the drizzle and asked a person there if he knew what time there would be an
                        eighty bus. Instead of answering my question he said, “Don’t you work at
                        —------?” (I forget the name). “No”, I replied, “I don’t”. “You’re very
                        much like a man I know who works there”. “Really!” “You caught a bus here last
                        week, didn’t you?” “Yes, I did. It seems like a case of once I’m seen, I am
                        never forgotten.” “Oh!” he replied, “I noticed the resemblance last week.
                        Hasn’t your young lady come to see you off tonight?” “I got on round the
                        corner”, I snapped, “what time will there be an eighty bus?” Who he was I don’t
                        know because he moved away very soon after without much more
                        conversation.</p>
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>On reaching town I found that the last bus had gone and so made my way to London
                        Road station and by the skin of my teeth managed to get the eleven o’clock
                        train as it was moving out of the station. I think in future I will use the
                        train; it is much more reliable. I was in doors here soon after 11-30, so it
                        wasn’t bad.</p>
                     
                     
                     <p> I hope you had good services at Platt Lane yesterday and that you will have a
                        good farewell meeting tonight. My services were very good on the whole. I had
                         Edgar Roberts, the minister at Hazel Grove, in my congregation in the
                        morning. He is on holiday but at home.</p>
                     
                     
                     <p>Could you see the flares from Chorlton last night? They were very near here and
                        looked most picturesque.</p>
                     
                     
                     <p>If it should rain next Saturday (I hope it will not, but if it should - ) maybe
                        we could arrange to see a picture or something. Anyway I’ll come down wet or
                        fine and we’ll cycle to Styalif it’s fine. I will get in
                        touch with the Henshalls during the week. I am waiting now for next
                        Saturday. With my love, Doreen,</p>

                     <u>Thursday.</u>
                     My Dear Doreen,
                     
                     
                     <p> It was delightful to get your letter yesterday with its various items of news.
                        I had looked forward to receiving it, but shall look forward with greater
                        eagerness to seeing you on Saturday. I will leave here on my bicycle at 1-30
                        but, as I don’t know how long the journey to your house will take, I cannot
                        say definitely what time I shall arrive. I ought to do it in just under an
                        hour, I should think. We’ll enjoy ourselves tremendously if it’s a decent day.
                         Styal is a lovely little spot and the woods are the
                        property of the Society which preserves our beauty spots.</p>
                     
                     
                     <p>The Dhalling Mhor friends have been doing quite a lof of corresponding. Dear old
                        Connie with her ‘dears’ and ‘loves’ is quite a character. Ruby would think she
                        was telling you ‘news’ when she imparted the information relating to
                        me.</p>
                     
                     
                     <p>After reading about the Farewell meeting I almost wished I was having one too.
                        But I shouldn’t like to think that I was moving a good distance away from this
                        district. You and I, Doreen, are fortunate; we might have lived miles away from
                        each other.</p>
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>The Hardings seem delightful people. They are generous with Sir Walter Scott. I
                        must make some arrangements regarding those books and get them out of their way.
                        Where I shall put them here I don’t know yet but I shall find some place
                        for them even at the risk of incurring my landlady’s wrath.</p>
                     
                     
                     <p>I have a funeral this morning and the interment is out at New Mills which means
                        that I shall not get back for dinner until about 1-15. One good thing: I have
                        not to walk to the house for the service; the undertaker is sending a taxi
                        - good man! Tonight, as I have no meeting, I shall have to settle down to
                        sermonizing. Sunday’s sermon is not yet prepared and, as it has got to be a
                        special one, I must get down to it seriously. I am going to take as my
                        text: “Let us build with you: for we seek your God, as ye do….. Ye have nothing
                        to do with us to build a house unto our God.”  I had my
                        subject announced last Sunday - Building Together.</p>
                     
                     Until Saturday - all my love, Yours affectionately,

                        having more opportunities of meeting you since Dhalling Mhor days my regard has
                        deepend into much more. I want you to know, Doreen, that I love you with
                        all my heart. You are the most beautiful, sweetest girl I have ever met and if I
                        didn’t love you I should feel that I was a creature without feeling. Every
                        moment of every day I am thinking about you and when I am with you that is
                        ecstasy par excellence. This is not being said lightly; Doreen, it is deep and
                        sincere. That is why I am expressing it to you first on paper. It is not
                        always easy for one to say in words what one feels in one’s heart and
                        although I intended saying this into your ear
                         yet the right psychological
                        moment didn’t seem to present itself. But I wanted you to know what I felt in my
                        heart before we see each other again; I could not wait for next
                        Saturday.</p>
                     
                     
                     <p>And now I shall await your next letter to find, I hope, that this feeling of
                        love is reciprocal. What things you and I, Doreen, can do together!
                        Everything seems different to me. Do you know the hymn - Loved with
                        everlasting love - 443? That hymn expresses what I feel.</p>
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>I find I am living from week-end to week-end eagerly anticipating each Saturday.
                        And I am so proud to introduce you to my friends.</p>

                        introduced. I placated her this morning when she poured out her grievance by

                     My dear Jim,
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>It was simply wonderful to receive your letter this morning. I am so happy
                        to think that we have so much in common. I do love you with all my heart
                         Jim, and I am so delighted to know that you feel the same towards me.
                        I am always thinking about you, and I am so proud to think you are doing
                        such a great work, which is the greatest thing in life. </p>

                     <p>This weekend will for ever live in my memory, dear. I enjoyed evey minute
                        of it. It was funny you should mention  hymn 443, as I was thinking
                        about that on Sunday. I remember once learning all the words off by heart.
                        It is such a  beautiful hymn, and can express one’s feelings far better
                        than words could ever do. </p>
                     
                     
                     <p> I am sure we shall have such  wonderful times together, Jim. </p>
                     
                     
                     <p> It seems so strange that we should live so near, and yet have to meet so
                        far away as  Scotland, but I am sure there
                        
                        3. 
                        must be some divine purpose behind
                        it all. </p>
                     
                     
                     <p> Do let me know what size gaiters you want. They have them in 26” - 30”
                        length. </p>
                     
                     <p> I called in to-day for your book, but it hadn’t come in, so I will go
                        again later in the week. </p>
                     
                     
                     <p>We had a grand swim yesterday, although it was a bit cold on first getting
                        in.</p>

                     <p> By the way, if you have any good ideas as to how we

                        programme.</p>

                     Sept.<u>2'</u>1942.
                     My Dearest Doreen,
                     
                     
                     
                     <p> You remember my telling you about receiving official notification about being
                        accepted for the ministry and my reaction to it - my joy - my effervescence -
                        well, that was nothing compared to the way in which I reacted to the reading of
                        your letter. It’s absolutely great, Doreen. No words can explain the ecstasy
                        or the delight I feel in my heart. I love you and you love me - two folks
                        feeling alike and having in common our love for our Lord Jesus Christ. All love
                        comes from God; it’s Divine and I can hardly wait for Saturday because then,
                        when we’re together, our love can be communicated in a way that pen and ink
                        can never communicate it. You are the grandest, finest, sweetest girl in
                        the world, Doreen; and I can hardly believe my good fortune to be true. But it
                        is, and as you say there must be some Divine purpose behind it all.</p>
                     
                     
                     <p>Just before going to Dhalling Mhor my work was getting on top of me; I had
                        worked hard and I was tired; but I was rather unhappy, too. I can’t explain it
                        properly but
                         it seemed as though I were
                        struggling alone. People so often didn’t understand; they let me down badly on
                        occasion. All that is altered now. I shall always think Dhalling Mhor a
                        blessed spot and I shall always remember the first Sunday morning at breakfast
                        when I asked (goodness knows why!) if there were any folks at the table from
                        Machester. Remember? </p>
                     
                     
                     <p> I am so glad you enjoyed your swim. Thanks for calling for the book<del>s</del>. And thanks awfully for bothering about the cape
                        and leggings. It’s so good of your Dad to let me have his coupons (your mother
                        and father have been wonderfully kind to me). I’ve tried to measure my leg- not
                        very successfully, I’m afraid - and I think I had better have the 30”.
                        </p>
                     
                     
                     <p> One thing that I think might go down well at your party, Doreen, is a little
                        play for two people supposed to be broadcasting. It’s done in the dark and the
                        two folks read from behind a screen or curtain. I’ve done it once and we
                        found it very good. I’ll get hold of the book for Saturday and then you can see
                        it. I might sing - then again, I might not - “If you want a bit o’Lancashire
                         we know where it is”. Joking
                        aside; I’ll ransack my brains and try and dig up some other ideas. What about
                        a beetle drive? I’ll bring my papers and dice if you decide on it. Beetle
                        always makes good entertainment. </p>
                     
                     
                     <p> I have had a letter from Mr. Bransly today in which he says among other things,
                         “I also heard from Home that you are going there for tea tonight. Well I shall
                        be thinking of you and wishing I were with you. I hope you all have a jolly
                        good tea, and I suppose you will excell yourself tonight at
                        preaching”. Everything is all right for a week next
                        Sunday, I hope, Doreen. We’ll have a good day then but a better the day
                        before.</p>
                     
                     
                     <p>This afternoon I have had a funeral and my Ladies’ class at Offerton and tonight
                        I am attending an interviewing committee in connection with the Youth Movement.
                        This beginning of the Connexional year is always a busy time but I love it.
                        I revel in circuit meetings; in talking to folks from different Churches; in
                        having fellowship with the ministers of the staff; and I know you love it, too.
                        On Friday we have a staff meeting at five; tea at six; and a stewards’
                        meeting after tea. The circuit stewards are always welcomed into the
                         staff meeting for a moment when
                        they hand out little envelopes containing quarterly cheques. Methodism is
                        wonderful and I am very proud to be able to serve her as a minister. There
                        can be nothing higher in life. </p>
                     
                     
                     Every little bit of me says, “I love you”.  God bless you, Doreen,
                     
                      Jim.  XX
