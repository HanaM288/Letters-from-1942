                       <p>My Dear Doreen,</p>
                      
                    
                        <p>Dhalling Mhor doesn’t seem like Dhalling <br> Mhor now you are not here. You had
                           become so <br> much a part of the life here, so far as I was <br> concerned, that
                           things seem a bit dead now<br> you have gone.</p>
                        
                        <p>By this time you will be at home<br> or very near home (time six o’clock) and
                           looking<br> mournfully at the weather; it’s bound to be raining<br> in Manchester as it
                           is here still. You have been<br> much in my thoughts as you made the beastly<br>
                           railway journey and I kept saying to myself, “They<br> will have reached Glasgow
                           now; they will be on the<br> M/C Manchester train now.”</p>
                        
                        <p> I can’t say how much I’ve missed<br> you today. I’ve wondered round a bit on my own,</p> </div>

                              older generation,<br> and slept a bit. Harry and Ellie, Jack and<br> Jean wanted me
                              to go to the pictures with<br> them but as they were going to see Gert and<br> Daisy I declined the invitation.</p>

                              you and I have<br> been used to hitherto. No doubt John<br> and I will do much
                              talking about Ruby<br> and ______ (well don’t be surprised if your ears<br> burn a
                              bit, too).</p>

                              and it’s<br> been sent on to your house; your address was<br> the one given in the
                              visitors book; remember?<br> You will be able to pass it on to Poppy.<br> You might

                           work next week if you<br> don’t feel like it; I’ll give you permission to<br>
