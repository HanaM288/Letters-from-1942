                     My Dear Doreen,
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>Dhalling Mhor doesn’t seem like Dhalling <br> Mhor now you are not here. You had
                        become so <br> much a part of the life here, so far as I was <br> concerned, that
                        things seem a bit dead now<br> you have gone.</p>
                     
                     <p>By this time you will be at home<br> or very near home (time six o’clock) and
                        looking mournfully at the weather; it’s bound to be raining<br> in Manchester as it
                        is here still. You have been<br> much in my thoughts as you made the beastly<br>
                        railway journey and I kept saying to myself, “They<br> will have reached Glasgow
                        now; they will be on the<br> M/CManchestertrain now.”</p>
                     
                     <p> I can’t say how much I’ve missed<br> you today. I’ve wondered round a bit on my own,<br>
                         and played cards a bit with the
                        older generation,<br> and slept a bit. Harry and Ellie, Jack and<br> Jean wanted me
                        to go to the pictures with<br> them but as they were going to see Gert and<br> Daisy I declined the invitation.</p>
                     
                     <p>I’ve moved my belongings into room 13<br> and find it’s a delightful room with a
                        nice<br> thick carpet which is much better than the<br> thin, loose mats to which
                        you and I have<br> been used to hitherto. No doubt John<br> and I will do much
                        talking about Ruby<br> and ______ (well don’t be surprised if your ears<br> burn a
                        bit, too).</p>
                     
                     <p>There was a letter here for Poppy.<br> Mr. Hendersonand I were re-addressing them
                        and it’s<br> been sent on to your house; your address was<br> the one given in the
                        visitors book; remember?<br> You will be able to pass it on to Poppy.<br> You might
                        note  that the stamp is placed<br>

                        shall<br> always be glad to hear from you and don’t<br> forget the tea. I looked in
                        my diary and<br> found that Sept. 7th. is the date of the Harvest<br> Festival
                        Lecture at the mission so please stear<br> clear of that date, won’t you?
                        I shall<br> count the days to Sept. with keen anticipation.<br> Don’t do too much
                        work next week if you<br> don’t feel like it; I’ll give you permission to<br>
                        
                         slack but don’t let the boss see you. Think<br> of
                        me on the hills (that’s where I shan’t<br> be if it keeps raining).<br>

                     <p>I ought to have said this morning,<br> ‘Thanks for helping to make my week’s
                        stay<br> at Dhalling Mhor such a happy one.’ This<br> second week will not be as
                        happy as the<br> first, I know. Do accept my thanks,<br> now. I feel so glad that
                        the week<br> afforded to us the opportunity of each other’s<br> company &amp; I

                     My dear Jim,
                     
                     
                     <p> Thank you ever so much for the<br> nice letter which you sent me. It<br> was good
                        of you to write so soon.<br> I, too, must say that it has been<br> the most
                        delightful holiday I have<br> ever spent, and would express<br> my sincere thanks
                        for the very<br> happy times which we had<br> together.<br>
                        </p>
                     
                     
                     <p> I have been into the office,<br> and have now got settled down<br> somewhat, but
                        all the same,<br> I can’t help wishing I was<br> back at Dhalling Mhor!<br>
                        </p>

                     <p> We were late arriving in Manchester<br> on Saturday. We got in about 7.0.<br>
                        instead of 5.0. You were quite<br> right in supposing that it would<br> be raining.
                        It certainly was, and<br> I do not think it has stopped<br> since.<br>
                        </p>
                     
                     
                     <p> I received Poppy’s letter here,<br> and have forwarded it on to<br> her, thank
                        you.<br></p>
                     
                     
                     <p> I am sending you a photograph,<br> which was recently taken, if you<br> care to
                        have it, as I think it is<br> a bit better than the one we<br> had taken at
                        Dunoon?<br>
                        </p>
                     
                     
                     <p>Enclosed you will find my £ 3.,<br> as I cannot spend them here<br> without losing
                        on them (I have<br> cultivated the Scotch habit, haven’t I?)<br>
                        </p>

                     <p> Perhaps we could have the<br> 21st “do”on the 12th September, if<br> this will be
                        convenient to you.<br> However, let me know, and then<br> we can fix it.<br></p>
                     
                     
                     <p> If ever you are in Manchester<br> before then, do not hesitate to go<br> into the
                        Central Hall and see<br> Dad, as I am sure he will<br> be pleased to meet
                        you.<br></p>
                     
                     
                     <p> I have been looking at the<br> photograph of Swanwick - 1939 -<br> and notice both
                        you and Dad<br> on it, so, no doubt, you<br> will recognise him when<br> you see
                        him.<br></p>
                     
                     
                     
                     4.
                     
                     <p> Well Jim! I do hope you<br> have a really good holiday, and<br> that you will feel
                        much better<br> for it when you come back.<br></p>
                     
                     
                     <p> I trust the weather will improve.<br> Please give my kind regards<br> to Jack and
                        Jean, Harry &amp; Ellie,<br> and, of course,John. Do not stay<br> awake talking
                        all night, will you?<br></p>
                     
                     <p>Dad was enquiring about Ruby,<br> and they said she will have<br> to see a
                        specialist, as it will<br> probably mean an operation.<br></p>
                     
                     All the very best, and<br> hoping to see you soon.<br> Yours very

                     My Dear Doreen,
                     
                     
                     
                     <p> Received your letter today and was<br> very pleased indeed to get it. Thanks
                        for<br> the photograph, it’s really lovely and I do<br> appreciate it very much.
                        When I get back<br> to Stockport it will have an honoured place<br> in my study
                        where I shall see it often<br> to remind me of you and of our friendship. <br></p>
                     
                     
                     <p>I have changed the 3 Scotch<br> notes for English ones; herewith enclosed. You<br>
                        don’t say that I should return them but<br> I am presuming I should. <br></p>
                     
                     
                     <p>This week has been much<br> different from last in many ways. First and<br>
                         foremost - you are not here; then the weather
                        <br>has been awfully bad until today; these<br> things have tended to make me a bit
                        fed<br> up. We have not been able to get out<br> much and you will realise that
                        being in<br> here day after day aimlessly whiling away<br> the time is not a good
                        thing. I have<br> slept much and played cards a bit and<br> in between the showers
                        and, on occasion, in<br> the showers have walked out with Harry or<br> Ellie or
                        rather Davies and Nora who has<br>
                        linked herself to him.<br></p>
                     
                     
                     <p>On Monday we did Rothesay again.<br> The sail was most exhilarating. The Clyde<br>
                        was ‘choppy’ and the boat tossed quite a<br> bit and took showers over the bow.
                        There<br> were some heavy showers of rain, too, but<br>

                        we
                        didn’t get very wet. After lunch we climbed<br> Barone hill, where I gathered the
                        heather I<br> sent you - which incidentally I hope you<br> received unsquashed and
                        smelling of the hills -<br> and where we saw something of the rugged<br> nature of
                        the hills lying behind Rothesay. We<br> saw Arran rising from the mists as the<br>
                        strong winds sent them swirling round the hills.<br> The demoralising walk back from
                        Innellan I <br>did by myself and wearily climbed Clyde Street<br> after a buffeting
                        day.<br></p>
                     
                     
                     <p>On Tuesday, in the rain, a few of<br> us went to Killcraigon and walked about<br>
                        five or six miles to Loch Long. The concert <br>in the evening was not bad but was
                        not<br> so good as last week’s. Wednesday was<br> rather a miserable day. We had showers<br> throughout
                        the day and after playing bowls in<br> the tournament I had an hour and a<br> half
                        lying on my bed. In the evening<br> nearly everybody went to the Cosy Corner so<br>
                        four of us - Mrs. Henderson, Mrs. Rawlinson and<br> Joan and I played
                        “Kan - U - Go”; a card<br> game but not an exciting one,
                        I’m afraid.<br></p>
                     
                     
                     <p>Today, Thursday, has been much better.<br> The sun has shone gloriously and we
                        have<br> had a fine excursion to Loch Eck and<br> Ardentinny. We walked along the
                        side of<br> the Loch to Whistlefield where we had lunch<br> and then over the hills
                        to Ardentinny. The<br> scenery beggars description; it is absolutely<br> exquisite
                        - the strong, silent hills contrasted<br> beautifully with the wooded, flowery
                        valleys;<br> and from time to time one caught a glimpse<br>

                        mentioning the photograph taken at<br> Swanwick - 1939 - I remembered the details of
                        its<br> being taken although I had forgotten about<br> it and it’s very likely that
                        I should<br> recognise your Dad. I must have a look<br> at it when I come to the
                        ‘do’ next month.<br> The 12th will be quite all right for me<br> and I shall look
                        forward to seeing<br> you and your parents then. It would<br> be jolly nice to see you before then and<br>
                        if you have a Saturday afternoon free in<br> a fortnight’s time maybe you’ll let
                        me<br> know and we could fix a re-union in<br> the City somewhere.<br></p>

                        will soon be over and the holiday ended,<br> but it will have served it’s purpose
                        and<br> I shall not be sorry to be back at<br> my work; it’s the greatest a man

                     My Dear Doreen,
                     
                     
                     <p> It was a great joy to me to receive your letter<br> yesterday afternoon but a
                        greater joy to read in it, ‘I am simply<br> delighted to think that our friendship
                        is still going to continue’.<br> It gives me a greater joy <del>that</del> than I can express in words<br> that both of us should feel so much
                        in accord. When there<br> is a true spirit of reciprocity between two people then
                        those two<br> are happy indeed; and, I trust, that the spirit of reciprocity<br>
                        that exists between us will grow stronger and deeper.<br></p>
                     
                     
                     <p>Sunday was a busy day but I was not<br> too busy to write because, in a sense, one
                        feels in writing<br> that one is in the presence of and actually speaking to
                        the<br> person concerned. That is how I feel about writing to<br> you. In the
                        evening on Sunday I was disconcerted<br> to find W. C.
                        Jackson, who, as you know, is an ex-president<br> of the Conference and very able
                        preacher, in the congregation<br>
                        
                         at Bramhall and I was rather ‘nervy’ as I took
                        the<br> service. However, God blessed us and we had a great time.<br> I spent an
                        hour with Mr. &amp; Mrs. Harold Darly on Sunday<br> evening poring over a map of
                        Scotland and pointing out<br> the places I had visited.<br></p>
                     
                     
                     <p> On Monday I made the journey to Wrexham and<br> returned yesterday. Last night
                        there was a good crowd at<br> my class and we had a very good meeting. I<br> didn’t
                        know that “How Green was my Valley” was in
                         Manchester.<br> It is reputed to be the finest picture of the
                        year. I<br> hope to see it, too, when I get the opportunity.<br></p>
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>It’s jolly good of your mother to suggest we<br> should have tea at your house on
                        Saturday. We shall<br> accept the invitation, shan’t we? I was going to<br> suggest
                        going out to Styalby train and having a<br> walk there and
                        tea at some friends of mine but we'll<br> do that some other Saturday.<br></p>
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>I shall have to leave this letter now as I<br>
                         have an appointment at 2-30 and
                        it’s already 2.20. So<br> until Saturday every good wish. My thoughts are
                        always<br> with you, Doreen,<br></p>

                     <p>Please excuse this paper but I’ve only just found that I<br> have used up all my
                        decent writing paper and it<br> was a case of this or nothing; and better
                        this<br> than nothing.<br></p>

                     <p>I had another letter from Connie this morning in which she<br> thanks me for the
                        heather and in which she gives<br> me a hearty welcome to Miss Rothwell’s flat
                        when<br> I’m in Leeds. If Miss Rothwell gets everybody<br> at her flat whom
                        she’s invited there I don’t<br> suppose there’ll be room for them. We’ll go
                        sometime<br> and give them a shock.<br></p>

                     August <u>24th</u>1942.
                     My Dear Doreen,
                     
                     
                     <p> You will see from the address that I am back in
                        Stockport<br> in spite of the fact that I missed the last
                        bus from town on Saturday.<br> Any little fear was worth suffering, however, for the
                        walk back to your<br> house from Hardings. The bus I jumped onto at the end of<br>
                         Cranboure Rd. was no good to me at all and the conductress put<br> me off when we
                        got round the corner into Wilbraham Road. I<br> went into a doorway to shelter from
                        the drizzle and asked a person<br> there if he knew what time there would be an
                        eighty bus. Instead<br> of answering my question he said, “Don’t you work at
                        —------?” (I<br> forget the name). “No”, I replied, “I don’t”. “You’re very<br>
                        much like a man I know who works there”. “Really!”<br> “You caught a bus here last
                        week, didn’t you?” “Yes, I<br> did. It seems like a case of once I’m seen, I am
                        never<br> forgotten.” “Oh!” he replied, “I noticed the resemblance last<br> week.
                        Hasn’t your young lady come to see you off tonight?”<br> “I got on round the
                        corner”, I snapped, “what time will<br> there be an eighty bus?” Who he was I don’t
                        know<br> because he moved away very soon after without much more
                        conversation.<br></p>
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>On reaching town I found that the last bus had<br> gone and so made my way to London
                        Road station and by the<br> skin of my teeth managed to get the eleven o’clock
                        train<br> as it was moving out of the station. I think in<br> future I will use the
                        train; it is much more reliable. I<br> was in doors here soon after 11-30, so it
                        wasn’t bad.<br></p>
                     
                     
                     <p> I hope you had good services at Platt Lane<br> yesterday and that you will have a
                        good farewell meeting<br> tonight. My services were very good on the whole. I had
                         Edgar<br> Roberts, the minister at Hazel Grove, in my congregation in the
                        morning.<br> He is on holiday but at home.<br></p>
                     
                     
                     <p>Could you see the flares from Chorlton last night? They<br> were very near here and
                        looked most picturesque.<br></p>
                     
                     
                     <p>If it should rain next Saturday (I hope it<br> will not, but if it should - ) maybe
                        we could arrange to see a<br> picture or something. Anyway I’ll come down wet or
                        fine and<br> we’ll cycle to Styalif it’s fine. I will get in
                        touch with<br> the Henshalls during the week. I am waiting now for next<br>
                        Saturday. With my love, Doreen,<br></p>

                     <u>Thursday.</u>
                     My Dear Doreen,
                     
                     
                     <p> It was delightful to get your letter yesterday with its various<br> items of news.
                        I had looked forward to receiving it, but shall look<br> forward with greater
                        eagerness to seeing you on Saturday. I will<br> leave here on my bicycle at 1-30
                        but, as I don’t know how<br> long the journey to your house will take, I cannot
                        say<br> definitely what time I shall arrive. I ought to do it in<br> just under an
                        hour, I should think. We’ll enjoy ourselves<br> tremendously if it’s a decent day.
                         Styal is a lovely little spot<br> and the woods are the
                        property of the Society which preserves our<br> beauty spots.<br></p>
                     
                     
                     <p>The Dhalling Mhor friends have been doing quite a lof of<br> corresponding. Dear old
                        Connie with her ‘dears’ and ‘loves’ is quite a<br> character. Ruby would think she
                        was telling you ‘news’ when she<br> imparted the information relating to
                        me.<br></p>
                     
                     
                     <p>After reading about the Farewell meeting I almost wished<br> I was having one too.
                        But I shouldn’t like to think that<br> I was moving a good distance away from this
                        district. You and<br> I, Doreen, are fortunate; we might have lived miles away from
                        each<br> other.<br></p>
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>The Hardings seem delightful people. They are generous<br> with Sir Walter Scott. I
                        must make some arrangements regarding those<br> books and get them out of their way.
                        Where I shall<br> put them here I don’t know yet but I shall find some<br> place
                        for them even at the risk of incurring my landlady’s<br> wrath.<br></p>
                     
                     
                     <p>I have a funeral this morning and the interment is<br> out at New Mills which means
                        that I shall not get back for<br> dinner until about 1-15. One good thing: I have
                        not to<br> walk to the house for the service; the undertaker is sending a<br> taxi
                        - good man! Tonight, as I have no meeting, I<br> shall have to settle down to
                        sermonizing. Sunday’s sermon is<br> not yet prepared and, as it has got to be a
                        special one,<br> I must get down to it seriously. I am going to<br> take as my
                        text: “Let us build with you: for we seek your<br> God, as ye do….. Ye have nothing
                        to do with us to build<br> a house unto our God.”  I had my
                        subject announced<br> last Sunday - Building Together.<br></p>

                        home about 10-30.<br></p>
                     
                     
                     <p>Don’t bother to get your cape yet, as<br> Dad says you can have his coupons<br>
                        
                         and I will try and see whether<br> Brown
                        Bros. have any.<br></p>
                     
                     
                     <p>I will call in for the book<br> to-morrow.<br></p>
                     
                     
                     <p> I am writing this in a hurry<br> before my breakfast, so I haven’t<br> very much
                        time.<br></p>

                     August<u>31'</u>1942.
                     My Dear Doreen,
                     
                     
                     
                     <p> I trust that without any mishap you arrived home<br> safely last night. It was
                        lovely to have you see the mission<br> and hear me preach and I hope you were not
                        disappointed<br> in either.<br></p>
                     
                     
                     <p>Ever since I met you at Dhalling Mhor I have<br> had a high regard for you but
                        having more opportunities of meeting<br> you since Dhalling Mhor days my regard has
                        deepend into<br> much more. I want you to know, Doreen, that I love you<br> with
                        all my heart. You are the most beautiful, sweetest girl<br> I have ever met and if I
                        didn’t love you I should feel<br> that I was a creature without feeling. Every
                        moment of every<br> day I am thinking about you and when I am with you<br> that is
                        ecstasy par excellence. This is not being said<br> lightly; Doreen, it is deep and
                        sincere. That is why I am<br> expressing it to you first on paper. It is not
                        always<br> easy for one to say in words what one feels in one’s<br> heart and
                        although I intended saying this into your ear<br>
                         yet the right psychological
                        moment didn’t seem to present itself.<br> But I wanted you to know what I felt in my
                        heart<br> before we see each other again; I could not wait for next<br>
                        Saturday.<br></p>
                     
                     
                     <p>And now I shall await your next letter to find,<br> I hope, that this feeling of
                        love is reciprocal. What<br> things you and I, Doreen, can do together!
                        Everything<br> seems different to me. Do you know the hymn - Loved with<br>
                        everlasting love - 443? That hymn expresses what I feel.<br></p>
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>I find I am living from week-end to week-end<br> eagerly anticipating each Saturday.
                        And I am so proud to<br> introduce you to my friends.<br></p>
                     
                     
                     <p> Mrs. Bithell, who saw you with Mrs. Bransly, is annoyed<br> because she wasn’t
                        introduced. I placated her this morning when<br> she poured out her grievance by
                        promising her that she would<br> meet you soon.<br></p>
                     
                     Every good wish, Doreen, and all my love,<br> Yours for ever,

                     My dear Jim,
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>It was simply wonderful to<br> receive your letter this morning.<br> I am so happy
                        to think that we<br> have so much in common. I do<br> love you with all my heart
                         Jim,<br> and I am so delighted to know<br> that you feel the same towards me.<br>
                        I am always thinking about you,<br> and I am so proud to think<br> you are doing
                        such a great<br> work, which is the greatest<br> thing in life. <br></p>

                     <p>This weekend will for ever<br> live in my memory, dear.<br> I enjoyed evey minute
                        of it.<br> It was funny you should mention <br> hymn 443, as I was thinking<br>
                        about that on Sunday. I remember<br> once learning all the words<br> off by heart.
                        It is such a <br> beautiful hymn, and can express<br> one’s feelings far better
                        than<br> words could ever do. <br></p>
                     
                     
                     <p> I am sure we shall have such <br> wonderful times together, Jim. <br></p>
                     
                     
                     <p> It seems so strange that we<br> should live so near, and yet<br> have to meet so
                        far away as <br> Scotland, but I am sure there<br>
                        
                        3. 
                        must be some divine purpose<br> behind
                        it all. <br></p>
                     
                     
                     <p> Do let me know what size<br> gaiters you want. They have<br> them in 26” - 30”
                        length. <br></p>
                     
                     <p> I called in to-day for your<br> book, but it hadn’t come in,<br> so I will go
                        again later in the week. <br></p>

                     <p>I am so much looking forward<br> to seeing you on Saturday.<br></p>
                     
                     
                     <p> By the way, if you have any<br> good ideas as to how we<br>

                     Sept.<u>2'</u>1942.
                     My Dearest Doreen,
                     
                     
                     
                     <p> You remember my telling you about receiving official notification<br> about being
                        accepted for the ministry and my reaction to it - my<br> joy - my effervescence -
                        well, that was nothing compared to the way<br> in which I reacted to the reading of
                        your letter. It’s<br> absolutely great, Doreen. No words can explain the ecstasy
                        or<br> the delight I feel in my heart. I love you and you love me -<br> two folks
                        feeling alike and having in common our love for<br> our Lord Jesus Christ. All love
                        comes from God; it’s Divine and<br> I can hardly wait for Saturday because then,
                        when we’re together,<br> our love can be communicated in a way that pen and ink
                        can<br> never communicate it. You are the grandest, finest, sweetest<br> girl in
                        the world, Doreen; and I can hardly believe my good<br> fortune to be true. But it
                        is, and as you say there must<br> be some Divine purpose behind it all.<br></p>
                     
                     
                     <p>Just before going to Dhalling Mhor my work was<br> getting on top of me; I had
                        worked hard and I was tired; but<br> I was rather unhappy, too. I can’t explain it
                        properly but<br>
                         it seemed as though I were
                        struggling alone. People so often<br> didn’t understand; they let me down badly on
                        occasion. All<br> that is altered now. I shall always think Dhalling Mhor<br> a
                        blessed spot and I shall always remember the first<br> Sunday morning at breakfast
                        when I asked (goodness knows<br> why!) if there were any folks at the table from
                        Machester.<br> Remember? <br></p>
                     
                     
                     <p> I am so glad you enjoyed your swim. Thanks for<br> calling for the book<del>s</del>. And thanks awfully for bothering about<br> the cape
                        and leggings. It’s so good of your Dad to let<br> me have his coupons (your mother
                        and father have been wonderfully<br> kind to me). I’ve tried to measure my leg- not
                        very<br> successfully, I’m afraid - and I think I had better have<br> the 30”.
                        <br></p>
                     
                     
                     <p> One thing that I think might go down well at<br> your party, Doreen, is a little
                        play for two people supposed<br> to be broadcasting. It’s done in the dark and the
                        two<br> folks read from behind a screen or curtain. I’ve done it once<br> and we
                        found it very good. I’ll get hold of the<br> book for Saturday and then you can see
                        it. I might<br> sing - then again, I might not - “If you want a bit o’Lancashire<br>
                         we know where it is”. Joking
                        aside; I’ll ransack my<br> brains and try and dig up some other ideas. What about
                        a<br> beetle drive? I’ll bring my papers and dice if you decide on<br> it. Beetle
                        always makes good entertainment. <br></p>
                     
                     
                     <p> I have had a letter from Mr. Bransly today in which<br> he says among other things,
                         “I also heard from Home that you are<br> going there for tea tonight. Well I shall
                        be thinking of you<br> and wishing I were with you. I hope you all have a jolly
                        good<br> tea, and I suppose you will excell yourself tonight at
                        preaching”.<br> Everything is all right for a week next
                        Sunday, I hope, Doreen.<br> We’ll have a good day then but a better the day<br>
                        before.<br></p>
                     
                     
                     <p>This afternoon I have had a funeral and my<br> Ladies’ class at Offerton and tonight
                        I am attending an interviewing<br> committee in connection with the Youth Movement.
                        This beginning<br> of the Connexional year is always a busy time but I love it.<br>
                        I revel in circuit meetings; in talking to folks from different<br> Churches; in
                        having fellowship with the ministers of the staff; and<br> I know you love it, too.
                        On Friday we have a staff<br> meeting at five; tea at six; and a stewards’
                        meeting<br> after tea. The circuit stewards are always welcomed into the<br>
                         staff meeting for a moment when
                        they hand out little<br> envelopes containing quarterly cheques. Methodism is
                        wonderful<br> and I am very proud to be able to serve her as a<br> minister. There
                        can be nothing higher in life. <br></p>
                     
                     
                     Every little bit of me says, “I love you”. <br> God bless you, Doreen,<br>
