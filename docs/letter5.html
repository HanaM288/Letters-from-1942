         <p> My Dear Doreen,</p>
          
          
          <p> It was a great joy to me to receive your letter<br> yesterday afternoon but a
             greater joy to read in it, ‘I am simply<br> delighted to think that our friendship
             is still going to continue’.<br> It gives me a greater joy <del>that</del> than I can express in words<br> that both of us should feel so much
             in accord. When there<br> is a true spirit of reciprocity between two people then
             those two<br> are happy indeed; and, I trust, that the spirit of reciprocity<br>
             that exists between us will grow stronger and deeper.<br></p>
          
          
          <p>Sunday was a busy day but I was not<br> too busy to write because, in a sense, one
             feels in writing<br> that one is in the presence of and actually speaking to
             the<br> person concerned. That is how I feel about writing to<br> you. In the
             evening on Sunday I was disconcerted<br> to find W. C.
             Jackson, who, as you know, is an ex-president<br> of the Conference and very able
             preacher, in the congregation<br>

             <p> at Bramhall and I was rather ‘nervy’ as I took
               the<br> service. However, God blessed us and we had a great time.<br> I spent an
               hour with Mr. &amp; Mrs. Harold Darly on Sunday<br> evening poring over a map of
               Scotland and pointing out<br> the places I had visited.<br></p>
            
            
            <p> On Monday I made the journey to <a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrexham" target="_blank">Wrexham</a> and<br> returned yesterday. Last night
               there was a good crowd at<br> my class and we had a very good meeting. I<br> didn’t
               know that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_Green_Was_My_Valley_(film)" target="_blank">“How Green was my Valley”</a> was in
                Manchester.<br> It is reputed to be the finest picture of the
               year. I<br> hope to see it, too, when I get the opportunity.<br></p>
            
            
            
            <p>It’s jolly good of your mother to suggest we<br> should have tea at your house on
               Saturday. We shall<br> accept the invitation, shan’t we? I was going to<br> suggest
               going out to Styal by train and having a<br> walk there and
               tea at some friends of mine but we'll<br> do that some other Saturday.<br></p>
            
            
            
            <p>I shall have to leave this letter now as I<br>

             <p>  have an appointment at 2-30 and
               it’s already 2.20. So<br> until Saturday every good wish. My thoughts are

            Please excuse this paper but I’ve only just found that I<br> have used up all my
               decent writing paper and it<br> was a case of this or nothing; and better
               this<br> than nothing.<br></p>
            
            
            
         <p>   P.P.S.
            
            I had another letter from Connie this morning in which she<br> thanks me for the
               heather and in which she gives<br> me a hearty welcome to Miss Rothwell’s flat
               when<br> I’m in Leeds. If Miss Rothwell gets everybody<br> at her flat whom
               she’s invited there I don’t<br> suppose there’ll be room for them. We’ll go
               sometime<br> and give them a shock.<br>
            <u>Jim.</u></p>
