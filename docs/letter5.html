                     My Dear Doreen,
                     
                     
                     <p> It was a great joy to me to receive your letter<br> yesterday afternoon but a
                        greater joy to read in it, ‘I am simply<br> delighted to think that our friendship
                        is still going to continue’.<br> It gives me a greater joy <del>that</del> than I can express in words<br> that both of us should feel so much
                        in accord. When there<br> is a true spirit of reciprocity between two people then
                        those two<br> are happy indeed; and, I trust, that the spirit of reciprocity<br>
                        that exists between us will grow stronger and deeper.<br></p>
                     
                     
                     <p>Sunday was a busy day but I was not<br> too busy to write because, in a sense, one
                        feels in writing<br> that one is in the presence of and actually speaking to
                        the<br> person concerned. That is how I feel about writing to<br> you. In the
                        evening on Sunday I was disconcerted<br> to find W. C.
                        Jackson, who, as you know, is an ex-president<br> of the Conference and very able
                        preacher, in the congregation<br>
                        
                         at Bramhall and I was rather ‘nervy’ as I took
                        the<br> service. However, God blessed us and we had a great time.<br> I spent an
                        hour with Mr. &amp; Mrs. Harold Darly on Sunday<br> evening poring over a map of
                        Scotland and pointing out<br> the places I had visited.<br></p>
                     
                     
                     <p> On Monday I made the journey to Wrexham and<br> returned yesterday. Last night
                        there was a good crowd at<br> my class and we had a very good meeting. I<br> didn’t
                        know that “How Green was my Valley” was in
                         Manchester.<br> It is reputed to be the finest picture of the
                        year. I<br> hope to see it, too, when I get the opportunity.<br></p>
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>It’s jolly good of your mother to suggest we<br> should have tea at your house on
                        Saturday. We shall<br> accept the invitation, shan’t we? I was going to<br> suggest
                        going out to Styalby train and having a<br> walk there and
                        tea at some friends of mine but we'll<br> do that some other Saturday.<br></p>
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>I shall have to leave this letter now as I<br>
                         have an appointment at 2-30 and
                        it’s already 2.20. So<br> until Saturday every good wish. My thoughts are
                        always<br> with you, Doreen,<br></p>
                     
                      Yours very sincerely, 
                     <u>Jim.</u>
                     
                     
                     
                     P.S.
                     
                     <p>Please excuse this paper but I’ve only just found that I<br> have used up all my
                        decent writing paper and it<br> was a case of this or nothing; and better
                        this<br> than nothing.<br></p>
                     
                     
                     
                     P.P.S.
                     
                     <p>I had another letter from Connie this morning in which she<br> thanks me for the
                        heather and in which she gives<br> me a hearty welcome to Miss Rothwell’s flat
                        when<br> I’m in Leeds. If Miss Rothwell gets everybody<br> at her flat whom
                        she’s invited there I don’t<br> suppose there’ll be room for them. We’ll go
                        sometime<br> and give them a shock.<br></p>
                     <u>Jim.</u>
