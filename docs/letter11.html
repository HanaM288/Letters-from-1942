                   <p>My Dearest Doreen,</p>
                     
                     
                     
                     <p> You remember my telling you about receiving official notification<br> about being
                        accepted for the ministry and my reaction to it - my<br> joy - my effervescence -
                        well, that was nothing compared to the way<br> in which I reacted to the reading of
                        your letter. It’s<br> absolutely great, Doreen. No words can explain the ecstasy
                        or<br> the delight I feel in my heart. I love you and you love me -<br> two folks
                        feeling alike and having in common our love for<br> our Lord Jesus Christ. All love
                        comes from God; it’s Divine and<br> I can hardly wait for Saturday because then,
                        when we’re together,<br> our love can be communicated in a way that pen and ink
                        can<br> never communicate it. You are the grandest, finest, sweetest<br> girl in
                        the world, Doreen; and I can hardly believe my good<br> fortune to be true. But it
                        is, and as you say there must<br> be some Divine purpose behind it all.<br></p>
                     
                     
                     <p>Just before going to Dhalling Mhor my work was<br> getting on top of me; I had
                        worked hard and I was tired; but<br> I was rather unhappy, too. I can’t explain it
                        properly but<br></p>

                    <p>it seemed as though I were
                     struggling alone. People so often<br> didn’t understand; they let me down badly on
                     occasion. All<br> that is altered now. I shall always think Dhalling Mhor<br> a
                     blessed spot and I shall always remember the first<br> Sunday morning at breakfast
                     when I asked (goodness knows<br> why!) if there were any folks at the table from
                     Machester.<br> Remember? <br></p>
                  
                  
                  <p> I am so glad you enjoyed your swim. Thanks for<br> calling for the book<del>s</del>. And thanks awfully for bothering about<br> the cape
                     and leggings. It’s so good of your Dad to let<br> me have his coupons (your mother
                     and father have been wonderfully<br> kind to me). I’ve tried to measure my leg- not
                     very<br> successfully, I’m afraid - and I think I had better have<br> the 30”.

                  <p> One thing that I think might go down well at<br> your party, Doreen, is a little
                     play for two people supposed<br> to be broadcasting. It’s done in the dark and the
                     two<br> folks read from behind a screen or curtain. I’ve done it once<br> and we
                     found it very good. I’ll get hold of the<br> book for Saturday and then you can see
                     it. I might<br> sing - then again, I might not - “If you want a bit o’Lancashire<br></p>

                    <p>we know where it is”. Joking
                     aside; I’ll ransack my<br> brains and try and dig up some other ideas. What about
                     a<br> beetle drive? I’ll bring my papers and dice if you decide on<br> it. Beetle
                     always makes good entertainment. <br></p>
                  
                  
                  <p> I have had a letter from Mr. Bransly today in which<br> he says among other things,
                      “I also heard from Home that you are<br> going there for tea tonight. Well I shall
                     be thinking of you<br> and wishing I were with you. I hope you all have a jolly
                     good<br> tea, and I suppose you will excell yourself tonight at
                     preaching”.<br> Everything is all right for a week next
                     Sunday, I hope, Doreen.<br> We’ll have a good day then but a better the day<br>
                     before.<br></p>
                  
                  
                  <p>This afternoon I have had a funeral and my<br> Ladies’ class at Offerton and tonight
                     I am attending an interviewing<br> committee in connection with the Youth Movement.
                     This beginning<br> of the Connexional year is always a busy time but I love it.<br>
                     I revel in circuit meetings; in talking to folks from different<br> Churches; in
                     having fellowship with the ministers of the staff; and<br> I know you love it, too.
                     On Friday we have a staff<br> meeting at five; tea at six; and a stewards’
                     meeting<br> after tea. The circuit stewards are always welcomed into the<br></p>
