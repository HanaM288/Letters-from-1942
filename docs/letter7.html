                     <u>Thursday.</u>
                     My Dear Doreen,
                     
                     
                     <p> It was delightful to get your letter yesterday with its various<br> items of news.
                        I had looked forward to receiving it, but shall look<br> forward with greater
                        eagerness to seeing you on Saturday. I will<br> leave here on my bicycle at 1-30
                        but, as I don’t know how<br> long the journey to your house will take, I cannot
                        say<br> definitely what time I shall arrive. I ought to do it in<br> just under an
                        hour, I should think. We’ll enjoy ourselves<br> tremendously if it’s a decent day.
                         Styal is a lovely little spot<br> and the woods are the
                        property of the Society which preserves our<br> beauty spots.<br></p>
                     
                     
                     <p>The Dhalling Mhor friends have been doing quite a lof of<br> corresponding. Dear old
                        Connie with her ‘dears’ and ‘loves’ is quite a<br> character. Ruby would think she
                        was telling you ‘news’ when she<br> imparted the information relating to
                        me.<br></p>
                     
                     
                     <p>After reading about the Farewell meeting I almost wished<br> I was having one too.
                        But I shouldn’t like to think that<br> I was moving a good distance away from this
                        district. You and<br> I, Doreen, are fortunate; we might have lived miles away from
                        each<br> other.<br></p>
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>The Hardings seem delightful people. They are generous<br> with Sir Walter Scott. I
                        must make some arrangements regarding those<br> books and get them out of their way.
                        Where I shall<br> put them here I don’t know yet but I shall find some<br> place
                        for them even at the risk of incurring my landlady’s<br> wrath.<br></p>
                     
                     
                     <p>I have a funeral this morning and the interment is<br> out at New Mills which means
                        that I shall not get back for<br> dinner until about 1-15. One good thing: I have
                        not to<br> walk to the house for the service; the undertaker is sending a<br> taxi
                        - good man! Tonight, as I have no meeting, I<br> shall have to settle down to
                        sermonizing. Sunday’s sermon is<br> not yet prepared and, as it has got to be a
                        special one,<br> I must get down to it seriously. I am going to<br> take as my
                        text: “Let us build with you: for we seek your<br> God, as ye do….. Ye have nothing
                        to do with us to build<br> a house unto our God.”  I had my
                        subject announced<br> last Sunday - Building Together.<br></p>
                     
                     Until Saturday - all my love,<br> Yours affectionately,
                     <u>Jim.</u>
