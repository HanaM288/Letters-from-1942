                <p> My dear Jim,</p>
                  
                  
                  <p> Thank you ever so much for the<br> nice letter which you sent me. It<br> was good
                     of you to write so soon.<br> I, too, must say that it has been<br> the most
                     delightful holiday I have<br> ever spent, and would express<br> my sincere thanks
                     for the very<br> happy times which we had<br> together.<br>
                     </p>
                  
                  
                  <p> I have been into the office,<br> and have now got settled down<br> somewhat, but
                     all the same,<br> I can’t help wishing I was<br> back at Dhalling Mhor!<br>

                  <p> We were late arriving in Manchester<br> on Saturday. We got in about 7.0.<br>
                     instead of 5.0. You were quite<br> right in supposing that it would<br> be raining.
                     It certainly was, and<br> I do not think it has stopped<br> since.<br>
                     </p>
                  
                  
                  <p> I received Poppy’s letter here,<br> and have forwarded it on to<br> her, thank
                     you.<br></p>
                  
                  
                  <p> I am sending you a photograph,<br> which was recently taken, if you<br> care to
                     have it, as I think it is<br> a bit better than the one we<br> had taken at
                     Dunoon?<br>
                     </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>Enclosed you will find my £ 3.,<br> as I cannot spend them here<br> without losing
                     on them (I have<br> cultivated the Scotch habit, haven’t I?)<br>

                  <p> Perhaps we could have the<br> 21st “do”on the 12th September, if<br> this will be
                     convenient to you.<br> However, let me know, and then<br> we can fix it.<br></p>
                  
                  
                  <p> If ever you are in Manchester<br> before then, do not hesitate to go<br> into the
                     Central Hall and see<br> Dad, as I am sure he will<br> be pleased to meet
                     you.<br></p>
                  
                  
                  <p> I have been looking at the<br> photograph of Swanwick - 1939 -<br> and notice both
                     you and Dad<br> on it, so, no doubt, you<br> will recognise him when<br> you see
                     him.<br></p>

                  <p> Well Jim! I do hope you<br> have a really good holiday, and<br> that you will feel
                     much better<br> for it when you come back.<br></p>
                  
                  
                  <p> I trust the weather will improve.<br> Please give my kind regards<br> to Jack and
                     Jean, Harry &amp; Ellie,<br> and, of course,John. Do not stay<br> awake talking
                     all night, will you?<br></p>
                  
                  <p>Dad was enquiring about Ruby,<br> and they said she will have<br> to see a
                     specialist, as it will<br> probably mean an operation.<br></p>
                  
                  All the very best, and<br> hoping to see you soon.<br> Yours very
