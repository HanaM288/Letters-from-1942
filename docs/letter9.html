                    <p> My Dear Doreen,</p>
                     
                     
                     
                     <p> I trust that without any mishap you arrived home<br> safely last night. It was
                        lovely to have you see the mission<br> and hear me preach and I hope you were not
                        disappointed<br> in either.<br></p>
                     
                     
                     <p>Ever since I met you at Dhalling Mhor I have<br> had a high regard for you but
                        having more opportunities of meeting<br> you since Dhalling Mhor days my regard has
                        deepend into<br> much more. I want you to know, Doreen, that I love you<br> with
                        all my heart. You are the most beautiful, sweetest girl<br> I have ever met and if I
                        didn’t love you I should feel<br> that I was a creature without feeling. Every
                        moment of every<br> day I am thinking about you and when I am with you<br> that is
                        ecstasy par excellence. This is not being said<br> lightly; Doreen, it is deep and
                        sincere. That is why I am<br> expressing it to you first on paper. It is not
                        always<br> easy for one to say in words what one feels in one’s<br> heart and
                        although I intended saying this into your ear<br></p>

                     <br>
                    <p>yet the right psychological
                     moment didn’t seem to present itself.<br> But I wanted you to know what I felt in my
                     heart<br> before we see each other again; I could not wait for next<br>
                     Saturday.<br></p>
                  
                  
                  <p>And now I shall await your next letter to find,<br> I hope, that this feeling of
                     love is reciprocal. What<br> things you and I, Doreen, can do together!
                     Everything<br> seems different to me. Do you know the hymn - Loved with<br>
                     everlasting love - 443? That hymn expresses what I feel.<br></p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p>I find I am living from week-end to week-end<br> eagerly anticipating each Saturday.
                     And I am so proud to<br> introduce you to my friends.<br></p>
                  
                  
                  <p> Mrs. Bithell, who saw you with Mrs. Bransly, is annoyed<br> because she wasn’t
                     introduced. I placated her this morning when<br> she poured out her grievance by
                     promising her that she would<br> meet you soon.<br></p>
                  
                <p>  Every good wish, Doreen, and all my love,<br> Yours for ever,<br>
