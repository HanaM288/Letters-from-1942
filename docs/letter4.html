                     My dear Jim,
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>Very many thanks for your<br> letter, which I was pleased to<br> receive. I am
                        simply delighted<br> to think that our friendship is<br> still going to continue,
                        and<br> I hope we shall have very<br> many happy times together.<br></p>
                     
                     <p>It was good of you to spare<br> a few minutes to write to me<br> on Sunday, as I
                        know how <br>busy you must have been,<br> and I do appreciate it Jim.<br> It is
                         Morris’ last Sunday next<br> week.<br></p>
                     
                     
                     2.
                     
                     <p>Our new minister, who is coming<br> in September, the one
                        from<br>Headingley College, is named<br> “Rees”. Dad had a
                        letter from<br> him, and I understand he<br> lives in Cardiff.<br></p>
                     
                     
                     <p>I think Margaret and I<br> are going to the Paramount to see<br> “How Green was my
                        Valley”, as<br> it is supposed to be such a<br> good
                        film.<br></p>
                     
                     
                     <p>On Wednesday, I am going<br> with the Platt Lane League<br> to Hartley College,
                        where some<br> of them are playing in a <br>tennis tournament. Needless<br> to
                        say, I am not playing tennis.<br></p>
                     
                     
                     3.
                     
                     
                     <p>It would certainly have been<br> lovely if we could have had<br> our full
                        fortnight’s holiday<br> together Jim, but still it<br> was grand to have had a<br>
                        week, wasn’t it.<br></p>
                     
                     
                     <p>I am so glad you like<br> Mother and Dad, as I am sure<br> they will always make
                        you very<br> welcome. Mother suggested that<br> on Saturday, we may as well<br>
                        come back hometo tea, as it<br> would be better than having<br> to get it out
                        somewhere.<br></p>
                     
                     
                     <p>Perhaps you would like me<br> to show you where Platt Church<br> is, as it would be
                        a nice walk &amp;<br>
                        
                         a friend of mine - Daisy<br> Harding - from
                        church, has<br> gone to Dhalling Mhor for this<br> week, so I suppose she will
                        <br>have a great time if the<br> weather improves. She has<br> joined up in the
                        NAAFI’S, and<br> is stationed in Gloucester
                        at<br> present.<br></p>
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>I shall be looking forward<br> to seeing you again on Saturday,<br> at
                         3-oclock.<br></p>
