                     <p>This digitisation project has been carried out as part of the Digitising Culture Heritage Materials course at 
                         the University of Bor√•s. We were tasked with carrying out a digitisation project through all stages from material selection and planning to 
                         publication on a website that we have created. 
                         
                         The collection comprises 11 letters written in August and September 1942 between two young people in their twenties in England during World War II.
                         The 11 letters chosen for this project are a sample of a much bigger collection of letters and sermons. The letters span from 1942 until the early 
                         1950s after the end of the war. 
                         The collection gives in an insight into communication in daily life in a pre-digital era during a pivotal time in world history.

                     <p>
                         The letters were written by James (Jim) and Doreen Mills (nee Brown) when they were in their early twenties. They first met at a Methodist hotel called 
                         Dhalling Mhor in Scotland in the summer of 1942 whilst both on holiday and they maintained a correspondence for many years. 

                         Both James and Doreen were greatly involved in the Methodist Chruch throughout their lives. James was a Methodist minister and worked in many areas of the 
                         United Kingdom as well as spending a period of time at a church in the United States. Doreen was just about to turn 21 at the time they met and worked as 
                         Medical Secretary for many years, often typing up Jim's sermons for him. Although meeting for the first time in Scotland, James and Doreen 
                         were both from the Greater Manchester area, they would eventually marry in 1947 and were married for over 70 years.
