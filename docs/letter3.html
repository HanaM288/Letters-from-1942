                        My Dear Doreen,
                        
                        
                        
                        <p> Received your letter today and was<br> very pleased indeed to get it. Thanks
                           for<br> the photograph, it’s really lovely and I do<br> appreciate it very much.
                           When I get back<br> to Stockport it will have an honoured place<br> in my study
                           where I shall see it often<br> to remind me of you and of our friendship. <br></p>
                        
                        
                        <p>I have changed the 3 Scotch<br> notes for English ones; herewith enclosed. You<br>
                           don’t say that I should return them but<br> I am presuming I should. <br></p>
                        
                        
                        <p>This week has been much<br> different from last in many ways. First and<br>
                            foremost - you are not here; then the weather
                           <br>has been awfully bad until today; these<br> things have tended to make me a bit
                           fed<br> up. We have not been able to get out<br> much and you will realise that
                           being in<br> here day after day aimlessly whiling away<br> the time is not a good
                           thing. I have<br> slept much and played cards a bit and<br> in between the showers
                           and, on occasion, in<br> the showers have walked out with Harry or<br> Ellie or
                           rather Davies and Nora who has<br>
                           linked herself to him.<br></p>
                        
                        
                        <p>On Monday we did Rothesay again.<br> The sail was most exhilarating. The Clyde<br>
                           was ‘choppy’ and the boat tossed quite a<br> bit and took showers over the bow.
                           There<br> were some heavy showers of rain, too, but<br>

                           <u>2.</u> 
                           we
                           didn’t get very wet. After lunch we climbed<br> Barone hill, where I gathered the
                           heather I<br> sent you - which incidentally I hope you<br> received unsquashed and
                           smelling of the hills -<br> and where we saw something of the rugged<br> nature of
                           the hills lying behind Rothesay. We<br> saw Arran rising from the mists as the<br>
                           strong winds sent them swirling round the hills.<br> The demoralising walk back from
                           Innellan I <br>did by myself and wearily climbed Clyde Street<br> after a buffeting
                           day.<br></p>
                        
                        
                        <p>On Tuesday, in the rain, a few of<br> us went to Killcraigon and walked about<br>
                           five or six miles to Loch Long. The concert <br>in the evening was not bad but was
                           not<br> so good as last week’s. Wednesday was<br> rather a miserable day. We had showers<br> throughout
                           the day and after playing bowls in<br> the tournament I had an hour and a<br> half
                           lying on my bed. In the evening<br> nearly everybody went to the Cosy Corner so<br>
                           four of us - Mrs. Henderson, Mrs. Rawlinson and<br> Joan and I played
                           “Kan - U - Go”; a card<br> game but not an exciting one,
                           I’m afraid.<br></p>
                        
                        
                        <p>Today, Thursday, has been much better.<br> The sun has shone gloriously and we
                           have<br> had a fine excursion to Loch Eck and<br> Ardentinny. We walked along the
                           side of<br> the Loch to Whistlefield where we had lunch<br> and then over the hills
                           to Ardentinny. The<br> scenery beggars description; it is absolutely<br> exquisite
                           - the strong, silent hills contrasted<br> beautifully with the wooded, flowery
                           valleys;<br> and from time to time one caught a glimpse<br>

                        <p>After all that talking about myself I’ll<br> go back to your letter - it was good to
                           get<br> it - and take up the points you make.<br> I certainly will ‘drop’ into the
                           Central Hall<br> and see you Dad whenever I’m in Manchester.<br> After your
                           mentioning the photograph taken at<br> Swanwick - 1939 - I remembered the details of
                           its<br> being taken although I had forgotten about<br> it and it’s very likely that
                           I should<br> recognise your Dad. I must have a look<br> at it when I come to the
                           ‘do’ next month.<br> The 12th will be quite all right for me<br> and I shall look
                           forward to seeing<br> you and your parents then. It would<br> be jolly nice to see you before then and<br>
                           if you have a Saturday afternoon free in<br> a fortnight’s time maybe you’ll let
                           me<br> know and we could fix a re-union in<br> the City somewhere.<br></p>
                        
                        
                        <p>I have passed on your good<br> wishes to the people you mentioned. This week<br>
                           will soon be over and the holiday ended,<br> but it will have served it’s purpose
                           and<br> I shall not be sorry to be back at<br> my work; it’s the greatest a man
                           could<br> do and I love it. Have you my<br> Stockport address? It’s
                           22 Maitland St.<br> Hempshaw Lane, Stockport. Do let me<br>
